1578849209,Natural Atheism,14.04,A384SQPY12385,David B. Pearson,0.95,5,1135123200,Outstanding Freethought,"Although I've pretty much always been a ""natural atheist,"" only in recent months have I been open about it. As such, my take on Dr. Eller's book was slightly different than what others might get out of it - as his sound reasoning in the early chapters of the book is somewhat mooted to the freethinker who has already drawn much the same conclusions.For me, the perhaps overlooked strength of Dr. Eller's book comes in the later chapters having to deal with the theist, and the ongoing struggle - traced from past to present - against the constant threat of fundamentalist-based oppression in today's society. As such, the book not only maps out the good reasons one should be an atheist, but also why one's right to reason should not be threatened by those who do not.""Natural Atheism"" is one of the best of the several books I've read on this topic, and is highly endorsed."

Of course, some of the writing is simple, and very very predictable, but it is worth checking out of the library, not worth really buying."

If it's a book about &quot;the coevolution of people and plagues&quot; (its subtitle), why are the author's world travels constantly thrown at the reader? &quot;One of my most searing memories is of being surrounded on a street in Hyderabad by a crowd of lepers.... I reached Vellore, a cheerful and relatively clean market town, after a hectic 120-kilometre bus ride from Madras....&quot;If the reader makes it past the travelogue, the reader will still have to get through the prose and commas. &quot;Yet the AIDS virus, despite its fearsome aspects, has had just as much difficulty in spreading through the human population as syphilis or typhoid, and has had to make equally dramatic compromises in order to retain its ability to spread&quot; is a typical sentence.The subject would be much better served if the author could stay on topic and the book was presented as an adventure to be discovered and enjoyed instead of making each sentence (and the book itself) a puzzle to be penetrated."
1550226614,The Death of WCW: WrestleCrap and Figure Four Weekly Present . . . (WrestleCrap series),11.99,A3OBW7ZP7B1Y1N,T. VanPool,1,4,1301788800,Made Me a Wrestling Fan,"By happenstance I watched a documentary about the WCW last week. I was intrigued, and remembered back to the late 1970s/early 1980s when I watched wrestlers such as Mr. Wrestling II, Andre the Giant, and Ric Flair wrestle on the Superstation. That touch of nostalgia led me to be curious about the history and fall of the WCW, with its colorful characters and turbulent history. I bought this book, and found it wonderful.As someone who didn't know anything about wrestling other than a vague recollection of a couple of names, I found it an easy read. Although I didn't know all of the characters immediately, there was sufficient detail in the book to help me appreciate them without extensive background exposure. Plus, I learned who they were through excellent discussions of their context. The wrestling jargon was introduced in a straightforward manner, and I found the book to be very entertaining.Oddly, I found myself being drawn into the story of wrestling in a way I had not expected. I intended for the book to just be a bit of brain-dead fun and really didn't think I would read the whole thing. Instead I finished reading it in three days, which, given my wife and kids, reflects a near obsession on my part. The real story of the characters was so compelling that I now want to follow the story lines of the nWo and other successful ""angles"". Fortunately, I have been able to find some matches on Youtube and Netflix. I look forward to following the WWE, although the last chapter of this book on the ""Invasion"" makes me wonder if it will be any better than some of the shenanigans the authors describe at the WCW...Although the book is fun and informative, it does have some weaknesses. I assume that it is an accurate account, given that I have no background knowledge with which to evaluate it. However, it does present what must be opinion as fact. One of the other reviewers noted this issue, in that people's motives and thoughts are presented with absolute certainty, which simply isn't possible. Also, the logic used to evaluate the various choices of the WCW seems contradictory at times. For example, the authors frequently complain about how bad, boring, and illogical episodes of Nitro were during the late 1990s/early 2000s, but then mock the program for including content that ""people would pay for."" Maybe I just don't understand, but wouldn't including matches that people want to see be the way to improve Nitro? Could Nitro's quality be increased without doing this? I understand that there were serious booking problems, but it seems as if the book is sometimes critical of the producers/bookers regardless of what they did. They are ""damned if the do"" include good matches on Nitro and ""damned if they don't.""Regardless, this is a really neat book, and I recommend it for the novice wrestling fan who just wants to learn something about this interesting history. I also suspect that hard core wrestling fans will enjoy it too (as reflected in the other reviews)."

Being a former Navy man who had sailed the Mediterranean, I really enjoyed seeing how many things were similar to my cruise in the Med over 100 years later.The editors did a great job and I really appreciated the footnotes. This book is a must read for any one looking into what life was like on a Civil War warship and the only one still in existence today!

019437212X,Second Language Acquisition (Oxford Introduction to Language Study Series),16.49,A1SCD2NYTIAQTY,Bu-Chan,1,4,1184889600,A Great Little Intro,"Rod Ellis is pretty much the guru on second language acquisition in this part of the world and usually writes some pretty heavy books on the subject. This little book, weighing in at just over 100 pages, stands in stark contrast.As the title of the series suggests, this is an introduction only and not for people who are already well-versed in second language acquistion theory. This book was really written for those wanting a launching point to further reading or just a quick overview of the main concepts, brief historical developments and some of the terminology.The majority of the book deals with various aspects of a learners interlanguage, taking in social, psycholinguistic and other facets. It also looks at variation between students, Universal Grammar and a few more topics. None are dealt with in to any great depth, but there is enough to give you some good insights into what you may have observed in the classroom. The discussion on developmental stages was particularly useful in this regard.LikePragmatics (Oxford Introductions to Language Study), this book is not a heavy read that bombards one with lashes of indecipherable terminology. Easy on the brain, it is a very good starting point for people interested in the field. Definitely recommended!"

Along with his beautiful lady love Dulcie...I never imagained books so entertaining.I am a huge fan of The Cat who series, The Mrs. Murphy mysteries, and another fav are the Midnight Louie Mysteries. But these have something so different to offer. These felines actually can have a full conversation with their owners. And when they ever go and get their food from the frig. It will warm your heart.The mysteries themselves are inventive, the characters well rounded. I was never bored reading this book. And I highly recommend this series to anyone who has read any of the other Cat Mysteries that I have listed above.Thank You Shirley Rousseau Murphy for adding choices to my cozy cat mysteries."
1901983994,Chess Tactics for Kids,11.53,A3G2P73NI8V6GU,"Mike H ""Livin in the Past""",1,5,1347321600,"Excellent For Beginners, A Complete Tactics Primer","While I prefer Susan Polgar's ""Chess Tactics For Champions"" for a first book on tactics, this book, in the long run, is superior to hers. Fifty tactical motifs, all very well explained by Murray Chandler. I'm around 1600 USCF and while I ended up with a 52-of-54 score on the final test (two small errors prevented elusive perfection), I wouldn't exactly call this book easy. But the bottom line is your kid -- or any beginner -- can't go wrong with this. Keep checking it out now and again after you've read it and your tactics will be solid.Some tactics are fairly deep, but overall it's a good prep course for John Nunn's ""Learn Chess Tactics"" and then Fred Reinfeld's awesome ""1001 Winning Chess Sacrifices and Combinations,"" (although Reinfeld's books are in descriptive notation, they are excellent to build one's pattern recognition and horizon). Three good checkmate books (in recommended reading order) are: Chandler's misnamed ""How to Beat Your Dad at Chess,"" ""The Art of Checkmate,"" by Georges Renaud, and Reinfeld's ""1001 Brilliant Ways to Checkmate.""Don't hesitate to buy this book!"
1931836140,IT Ethics Handbook: Right and Wrong for IT Professionals,53.95,A3YYGS0XCE1F,"Christopher Byrne ""The Business Controls Caddy""",0,3,1099267200,How Do You Truly Define Ethical Right and Wrong in IT?,"When do we as information technology professionals cross the line ethically? Who us to say what is right or wrong? Are there absolutes? Or is everything just relative. These are some of the questions posed by Stephen Northcutt in IT Ethics Handbook - Right and Wrong for IT Professionals ( 648 pages ; Syngress, 2004). The only problem is that for this reader, the book left me with more questions than it answered, though I found the many examples and ""case studies"" included would provide good references for discussion purposes.The first thing that caught my attention was the author's identification of ""moral relativism"" as one of the dominant ""religious thoughts"" in the world today. The author also boldly states that in many cases ""moral relativism"" will ""rapidly get you fired in the workplace"". This latter statement may or may not be true, but itstruck me more as an ethical goal in a perfect world than as statement of fact. And there is no way in the world that this reader would consider ""moral relativism"" a stream of religious thought because it has no grounding in religion at all. It is a by-product of the drive for a secular society in today's world. It seems that the author does acknowledge to some degree that moral relativism is a culprit in the ethical quandaries of today, it serves as the framework for the discussion of each ethical issue raised, casting answers in a ""conservative"" and ""liberal"" point of view to show the extremes of the answers to different scenarios.It is here that the readers of this book would need to be very careful, as is the challenge in looking at any case study, since nothing is always cut and dry since a scenario does not always include all the factors that can drive it. The author does acknowledge this and states that every case study and answer set offered may or may not be applicable to given organizational circumstances.All of this being said, I would not recommend this book for anyone expecting to find cut and dry answers that they can apply to their organization. I would recommend it as a desk reference to use for ethics training session or to find information for the starting point of discussions for ethics issues that may arise at any given time in the workplace. The price is not that expensive that you would not get at least some value out of the book, even if it just challenges your thinking about what issues really fall under the realm if ""IT Ethics"" or how you would approach a given situation.The Business Controls Caddy Scorecard: Even on a Par 4"

Her best friend, Hope, has moved to Tennessee after Hope's brother died of a drug overdose. Jessica is a faithful diarist, and her story unfolds through diary entries and a monthly letter to Hope.Review: One of my best friends recommended this book to me, and I'm so glad she did! I loved Jessica Darling from the very beginning, and I wished the books were around when I was in high school because I would have loved them then too. Jessica is a wonderfully honest narrator, but the reader can still see how she struggles with her self-esteem. Jessica's perception of herself is not always the exact reality, but it's refreshing to read a story with enough depth to let the reader understand the narrator's point of view and alternate points of view. Are any of us truly aware of our exact gifts, talents and perspective to others? The novel is tender, funny and true. Jessica Darling truly feels like a friend after reading this book. I was so glad to discover this book eight years after it was published so I could read the next in the series right away."

The Violet Flame of Saint Germain the highest gift that humanity has ever received, although I also link it to Archangel Zadkiel.When I feel fear, when I am stuck, when I have a negative emotion; when I feel that I am out of the flow or out of control of external factors affecting my life; when someone is sick or need clarity or help; when I can no longer visualize my destiny or my future... and in many other occasions, I visualize the Violet Flame and I tell the poem that comes in the book out loud, again and again, until my feeling shifts and I am at peace.As soon as I read this poem I memorized it because I recognized that this was my way to re-center, re-balance and re-focus myself.This is definitely a very little book with a very big punch!"

Of course every reader will have his or her own favorites from the bill of fare, but for my part, the only authors I could have done without were Verne--who seemed out of place with his Hoffmannesque Master Zacharius--and Gerard de Nerval, who apparently was going mad when he wrote Aurelia--I felt as if he were trying to drive me mad when I read it! But most everything else in the anthology is enjoyable. Some standouts include Merimee, Gautier, and Dumas. The editor also provides an excellent introduction to the tales and authors. So for anyone who has a yen to feast on some fantastic 19th century French short stories, Demons of the Night will certainly serve up a delightful read."

Shirley ""Laurie's Boomer Views""",1,5,1131494400,I Love L'Amour!,"This review refers to ""Beyond The Great Snow Mountains""(Short Story Collection) by Louis L'Amour.L'Amour fans, this short story collection is fabulous. Ten captivating classic stories that will have you turning the pages, as fast as you can. Each story is a fresh new experience. Adventure, Mystery, Intrigue, Suspense, Action and even a little romance. The action takes place on land, in the air, and on the water. And yes, some Western adventure as well. The main characters and heroes are always charismatic. Some are even based on real life adventurers he knew.L'Amour's own turn at being a miner and a boxer(as told in the Afterword by Beau L'Amour), is put to good use in some stories revolving around those subjects. The mining story ""Under The Hanging Wall"", is a suspense packed murder mystery, with all the usual suspects, and the action taking place in an abandoned and dangerous part of a mine. ""The Money Punch"" is the story of a young fighter with lessons to learn.In ""By the Waters of San Tadeo"" and ""Beyond the Great Snow Mountains"", women are the main character and heroines of the stories. One has a woman trying to escape danger and the other a woman torn between the Tribe she has become a part of and a chance to go back to her home.The stories range from 10 pages to 40 pages. And in that short time, L'Amour manages to tell great tales. Other works included are ""Meeting at Falmouth"", :Roundup In Texas"", ""Sideshow Champion"", ""Crash Landing"", ""Coast Patrol"", and ""The Gravel Pit"". A Dedication, and Afterward by Beau L'Amour and a short informative, ""About Louis L'Amour"" is also included in the book.I was delighted with every story in this collection. Louis L'Amour fans will love this one.Enjoy....Laurie"

Lange,0.8260869565217391,4,1156550400,"A Decent Effort, With Good Insights","This book starts slowly, and doesn't really take off until the second half, when one arrives at the chapter called ""The Gravy Train,"" which critiques the consultant-oriented way of DC Democratic politics. From that chapter on, the authors do a good job of discussing the current state of electoral politics, especially at the congressional level, and how the losing paradigm is slowly yielding to the new, ""netroots""-driven politics that were initiated with the Howard Dean presidential campaign in 2003.The best thing about this book is the insights of those politicians, campaign strategists, and fellow bloggers they personally interviewed. They make a strong case for a 50 state strategy and emphasis on person-to-person politics everywhere, rather than the traditional focus on people as parts of ""groups"" and ""categories"" to manipulate. They show how bloggers can help ignite a campaign through raising instant cash, such as the Paul Hackett campaign for Congress in Ohio.The book could have done without the introductory chapters, which are not terribly edifying. Their discussions of history are rote and suffer from some mistakes. For example, their reference to the I.W.W. calls them the ""International Workers of the World,"" but the name was actually ""Industrial Workers of the World."" They are on far more solid ground in discussing contemporary politics, however.I would have appreciated more expansive discussion of the authors' ideas about how the blogosphere could even more successfully work as a part of an integral strategy for the Democrats at state and local levels. They speak admiringly of how the right wing has created a force by recruiting, grooming, and nurturing young activists, developing a strong body of think tanks and research entities to produce ""ideas,"" rather than focus on policy, using the media skillfully, and engaging in advanced targeting that integrates political and consumer marketing data. Why not explore how the blogosphere can help with candidate recruitment, training, early fundraising, and media strategy beyond the internet? What about some tips for candidates and campaign staff to more effectively work in the blogosphere, market their campaigns, and add blogging to their own websites? Maybe they can do that in another book."
0756613434,Encyclopedia of Perennials (American Horticultural Society),26.4,A2OAD5Y7MXUOFZ,Laurie A. Brown,1,5,1275264000,Best Perennial Encyclopedia Ever,"This is a marvelous compendium of plants. Almost 500 pages of plant descriptions and beautiful color photographs make it a book that the curious gardener will dip into again and again. Plants are listed by genus and species, and a good number of cultivars are listed. Each genus is given a general description, followed by how it is best grown, how it's propagated, and what pests it has. Then follows the various species within the genus, descriptions including origin, size, bloom time, color and size, scent and occasional tidbits about medicinal use or the like. One thing I love about this book as opposed to many other plant encyclopedias: it gives the American zone hardiness of the species.But this is not just a straight encyclopedia; interspersed with the plants are sidebars and boxes with information on combining the plants to make beautiful vignettes that put plants with the same needs together, the structures of various types of flowers, plant history, diseases and pests of plants, and detailed propagation instructions for certain plants.This book is great for looking up information, but it's also wonderful for just leafing through it, stopping at reading at random spots- did you know that the Barlow type aquilegias make seed that's true to type, while all other aquilegia's promiscuously cross breed? And here I thought those Barlow girls were just as bad as their cousins! Drooling over this book has given me a lot of new ideas for the garden, and left me with serious zone envy."

However, deeper into the book, the author's cleverness in remarks begins to pall and his biases become more evident.

Yes, Egypt was open for the taking in the early stages of 1942 and possibly 43, but with Hitler not committing enough troops to take Egypt, the Middle East would just be a pipe-dream. If Hitler would have thrown enough troops for Rommel to take capture the oilfields of the Iran and Iraq, they would still have to hold them. To think England would wither and die without those countries is hardly feasible. The British Fleet would pull out and become a very formidable force in the Indian and Atlantic Oceans instead of being dispersed everywhere. In fact, that is one area Mr. Alexander keeps referring to through the book as the downfall of Hitler in spreading his forces thin.Hitler was going to invade Russia no matter what other countries he conquered. That was his main goal the whole time. He never forgave the communists he battled in the streets of Germany for control of the country. To think he had any other aims is not to know ""his"" history and beliefs.If Hitler would have made one concentrated strike at Moscow, Leningrad or the Ukraine, he would have still been required to consolidate the gains. That would prove impossible with his missions of destroying every living Russian. Seriously, the partisan bans that lived in the Pripet Marshes number over 100,00 and with the SS continuing with the policy of killing all ""sub-humans"" the populace would never succumb to Hitler or Nazi Germany. If a central thrust would have been set upon, the flanks would have been long and vulnerable to harrying attacks at any point.One reviewer talked about factual errors. I concur. One that jumped out was the the Tigers were not equipped with a machine gun which killed the northern pincer attack during the Battle of Kursk. It was the Ferdinand or as other called it the Elephant that was not equipped with a machine gun making it very vulnerable to infantry attacks. Many were knocked out by infantry and anti-tank guns as the monsters passed-by with no accompanying infantry support.This would be a fair book to provide novice readers and be introduced to WWII in Europe."

Bond ""Crusty Old Gamer""",1,5,897177600,MacDonald Fraser Scored A Knockout With Black Ajax!,"One of the delightful things about the work of George MacDonald Fraser is the wide range of subjects he addresses which are knit together by one singular talent - his ability to breath life into another era.Those who have only read The Flashman Papers (not a bad thing by any means) have only seen one facet of Mr. Fraser's talent. When he applied it in &quot;The Steel Bonnets&quot;, one of the most confusing, convoluted and bloody periods in English history leapt into focus. Now in addressing the doomed career of Tom Molineaux, a former slave who freed himself by beating another slave to death, Fraser sheds some much needed light on that contradictory period which was Regency England.Using Molineaux's brief career as the subject of an &quot;industrious inquirer&quot;, Fraser brings in the views of such diverse observers as an eccentric upper class &quot;pedestrian&quot; who - between walks to Scotland and back - trains Tom Cribb for the second bout, a boxing journalist of the period whose florid hyperbole disguises the fact that he is rarely able to actually attend the matches and, of course, Flash Harry's &quot;guv'ner&quot;, Buckley &quot;Mad Buck&quot; Flashman.&quot;Black Ajax&quot; reveals more about the attitudes, prejudices and life styles of the Regency than it really does about poor Tom Molineaux. For those looking for a politically correct read, look elsewhere for, as Fraser is fond of saying, history cannot be bent to suit today's attitudes and still remain history. For those who revel in Fraser's adept use of dialect and period slang and his ability to bring an entire era to life, this is for you."

What Oren does particularly well in this book is draw the curtain on the machinations of both Arabs and Israeli power brokers in the years, then days, then hours, leading up to conflict.What was particularly striking to this reader was the vastly significant role that the now-defunct Soviet Union played in provoking war in the area. Also eye-opening, but not entirely surprising, was how utterly toothless the U.N. was in helping alleviate tensions in the region.This excellent book leads to the inevitable question: Will there ever be an ""accommodation"" between Palestinians and Israelis? Maybe in some distant, enlightened future, but with the democratic election of Hamas in Palestinian territories, the short term prospects are bleak."

Henderson,1,5,1234915200,YOUR EYES WILL BE OPENED,"This well-written and shocking book about our country's dismal treatment of black Americans (mostly, but not exclusively) documents in gruesome detail some of the worst traits of man-on-man violence ever put on paper and I don't exaggerate when I say it is quite sickening how ingrained hate can effect whole communities. In some of the most hideous stories you won't hear about in grade school history, white violence against black people of all ages, sex or origin (mostly in the South, tho) are told with compelling narrative. You come to understand that it was a long haul from Reconstruction to voting rights laws, punctuated by the terror of being dragged out of your home and brutalized in the most terrible ways imaginable. Granted, some of those lynched were probably guilty of crimes they were accused of but none were given fair trials and even then, many were dragged out of police custody and killed outrageously in front of huge crowds. This is not a pleasant book but there are inspiring characters on the side of justice who worked long years to stamp out lynching and for that the author is credited with balancing a horrible subject that otherwise would be the most depressing history book ever. My only regret is that footnotes aren't apparent until you get to the end of the text and see there's a section of ""Notes"" that tells even more stories that could've been elaborated in real-time reading. But this caveat takes nothing away from this important book."

God knows how much time I've wasted, in rehearsal with or reading one of Shakespeare's plays, arguing with myself and others about how to say a word. This book clears everything up. It is to a scholar/actor of Shakespeare what Gray's Anatomy is to a medical student.It's also helpful for reading verse. I've dusted off tons of old books at libraries, looking for basic explanations of Shakespeare's verse. They seem to be written by authors who either have never taught other human beings (i.e., actors) or who think it is foolishly elementary to explain the basic concepts of verse in a way the average reader can understand.

Her books are more prose like and personal/emotional/subjective, whereas this book is really more like a *manual* that offers much of the same terrain in a more objective manner.Despite how short and concise each chapter is - sometimes just a two-page deal - I'm just amazed how incredibly *on the spot* every topic is! I think in terms of *relevancy* this is by far the most helpful literature for adult children that have to learn how to reparent themselves and learn how to set boundaries, and gain that *objective* cool observing eye to their FOO issues.I've deliberately waited a long time to write this review to see how the book stands with passing time, and I am very grateful to the authors and their staff who compiled it in such a unique and useful form.Among the recovery literature I have, this is the book I turn to the most after I feel a setback with interpersonal relationships or personal issues. If you are weak on boundaries, are married to or live with or work for very difficult NPD type individuals, and/or you suffer from OCD or Perfectionism, I would recommend you to give this book a chance to let its practical charm & wisdom rub off on you.At different points of your recovery - different parts of the books may surprise you; for me, the part called ""The Myth of Permanence"" was like that. I didn't feel anything the first time I read it, but like 2 or 3 years after I got this book, BAM! That chapter just completely blew my mind away and helped me put a name to a chronic dissatisfaction I was feeling well throughout my 20s. That short chapter basically gets to the heart of the heart of what Buddhism is about IMHO. I always felt like I was waiting for that *moment in my life* when things WILL all fall into place, and all my problems would be OVER FOR GOOD. I don't know how that thought crept into my mind, but after some years of quite traumatic relationship with a family member, that was all I could hold on to. Reading that chapter title completely held my attention that entire evening and that whole week; and it was a kind of a ZING! type of awakening to reality kind of experience for me. The book made me realize that what I need to do is move on and stop waiting for that DAY. It helped me get *unstuck*I love how all or most of the chapter titles get right to the point about so many multitudes of problems that a dysfunctional FOO can set up for adult children. This is a great reference guide and an indispensable navigational toolkit for me on my road to Maturity and learning what is normal/healthy/better.I have 2 other books that I can compare with this book; one is John Bradshaw's Family Secrets and the other is Emotional Blackmail. Although both were helpful to a degree, as the titles suggest, they focus more on the *problem* whereas this book helps you name and define the problem but is geared towards SOLUTION so that you can move on and get on with your living.My most recent surprise from this book was about the chapter on Otters and how Being Playful is Important. If you're looking for a boundaries book that is not too Christian, I think this book really is the best deal! :-) It covers a lot of terrain with excellent vocabulary choices, is relevant, organized, practical, and down to earth. It is NOT new-age, NOT too dark or critical or academic.OK. Take what you like and feel free to leave the rest. Good luck!"

As a result, not only have the characters grown up, but the books is definitely, definitely geared toward an older audience.The book doesn't take long to read. Unfortunately, that isn't a compliment. Parts are a struggle to get through, tedious and predictable. You keep going, however (a point in Pierce's favor) because despite the fact you can easily predict most of the outcomes, you still want to see how the characters go about doing what you know they'll do.Sandry's struggling to keep her freedom in a country where the Empress is determined to keep the wealth of the richest heiress in the country. It's a clearly political theme, where Pierce champions women's rights. I agree with the need to do so, but her male (key word, male) villains are lackluster and uninspired. You dislike them, but there's nothing to make you remember even the horrible things they did- they're two-dimensional and forgettable. Even Sandry herself seems to lack what made her so lovable in the earlier books. She has traces of the vibrant character she was, but she slips off into a less likable persona throughout this book- a sort of character devolution. Empress Berenene is the only `villain' that makes you actually think, whose reasons for doing what she does at least have reasons behind them rather than stupidity and greed and a desire to make life difficult for traveling mages.Briar, Tris and Daja are, of course, along for the ride. They all four returned from their various adventures (which, especially in the case of Briar, go rather beyond just the ones in the Circle Opens series) to discover they're too old to stay in Discipline, and have to go move elsewhere. They do so, and shortly after, are called to Namorn by Empress Berenene. Tris and Daja don't get as much time as Briar and Sandry, but it is nice to see the four characters at least in the same book together. Tris has become guarded and cold(er), and there is a clear set-up for her future (meaning Pierce has told us what the next book will be about). Daja's character takes a few...interesting turns, some of which are quite surprising, but at least unexpected.Briar is the character I have always loved most, and in this area, Pierce did not disappoint. For me, his character and actions are what kept me from putting this book down. It isn't his story, but he plays some important roles.You may not like some of the changes in the characters, but that's one of the interesting points this book has. The characters *themselves* don't like the changes in each other. You can see how they've drifted apart, to the point of purposely blocking the mental connection they had as kids. If nothing else, that fact will keep you reading- you want to keep going and try to see if they become close again.The plot may trite and predictable, the clich&eacute;s may be there, but it isn't a hopeless read. If you loved the characters from the earlier books, even a little, pick it up and try it. If you're like me, you'll be glad you did...but you'll be rather apathetic about whether or not you should wait anxiously for the next one to come out."

In high school I was the pretty girl and my best friend wasn't, and reading this novel just brought back those sad, sad memories of her hating me or arguing with me for something that I couldn't help.And you know how everyone treats an attractive girl -- people will say that she's more than likely going to be pregnant by the end of the year.

Kelly ""tom@tomkelly.us""",1,5,1057449600,"Improve your company, not just your product","Incremental improvements in your company's products (and services) produce incremental increases in revenue, profits, and market share... maybe. And once your competitors match or improve on your ideas, where is your advantage?Consumers respond to continuous improvement in the products they buy. But making small improvements isn't enough. To position your organization for excellence in the marketplace, you must not only embrace change in your products, you must continuously examine and improve your business model -- every aspect of how you conduct business, define your market, and deliver your products to your customers.In The Ultimate Competitive Advantage, Mitchell and Coles walk you through a process of analyzing your business model. The text begins by describing dozens of examples of companies that rethought the traditional business model for their market and delivered breakthrough performance and service for their customers. Bookstores are my favorite example -- changing from a corner shop where you'd spend a few minutes selecting and purchasing a book or two, to a library-sized facility that provides comfortable chairs for reading, a coffee shop for snacking while you read, and even entertainment on the weekends. Customers now spend hours in the bookstore, many finally being shoo-ed out at 11PM!Mitchell and Coles describe how to analyze customer opportunities, your company's operation, and organizing around flexibility in products, delivery, and markets. What does this mean to you and your company? Rather than making incremental improvements to your product, you are focusing on your customers' needs and how to fulfill them.Whether an individual contributor, a department manager, or the leader of your business, The Ultimate Competitive Advantage will give you new perspectives on going to market and staying ahead of the competition."

I quote, briefly:""I have to admit I have yet to read this particular title though I am compelled to avoid doing so in light of the ""brillient"" review it has been ""givern"" by the meticulously illiterate Paul Snow. I could be, probably justly, dubbed fastidious or pedantic for having the basic requirement of an inkling of understanding of the English language as a prequisite for myself paying any attention to a written review, but I don't think I am being overly demanding. I may have been quite willing to explore this particular title, but I have decided vehemently against doing so as a result of this Neanderthal's clear adoration for it.... As for Paul Snow's political views, I don't believe that there is any need for me to rebutt them...""To summarize Mark's argument:* He has not read Ms Charen's book.* He is ""compelled to avoid doing so"" because of another reviewer's misspellings.* He claims he only ""pays any attention"" to reviews that contain no spelling mistakes.* Yet, again, he emphasizes the high accord he gives this other reviewer: he has allowed the ""Neanderthal's"" poor spelling to control his own actions.* And then the coup de grace: Mark presumes such a lofty position of grandeur that he has no need to ""rebutt"" the review, let alone the book's arguments!Wow. I wonder... why are Useful Idiots compelled to ""butt in"" like this? God help us if the Spelling Police are the only ones with a handle on Truth.

The pictures and illustrations for seaming demonstrate both the technique itself and the finished seams. It has both bright color photos of the techniques, along with clear and sharp color drawings. The author wisely includes benefits and drawbacks with each method. It is formatted in a legible, easy to read way, which is key to me, as I am a visual learner. My favorite parts are the beginning, which clearly and consisely show 7 cast on techniques, and the buttonhole chapter, which demonstrates 8 various methods of making buttonholes, always a bane for me. All this in one book, with a shiny hard cover and spiral bound to boot. This book is sturdy enough to withstand wear and tear, yet small enough to carry in my knitting bag. I only wish the author would have expounded upon the short row techniques, but, as the title states, this book is about finishing, so the short row explanations are limited to preparation for binding off. Also, more could have been said about weaving in ends, as in lace or complicated patterning. Still, 5 big stars, a reference book not just for beginners, and a winner.

Accompanying her dead husband's father to fetch his niece from the troubled land, Ursula is asked by Elizabeth to carry an offer of mediation to Catherine, Queen Mother and Regent of France. Though she dislikes her father-in-law, Luke Blanchard, who was against his son's marriage and has spurned his young granddaughter, Ursula agrees to go partly in hopes of seeing her second husband, a leader of the Catholic faction in France. Joined by love, separated by politics, their relationship has several times landed them on opposite sides of armed and clandestine engagements (in previous books). The tradition continues as Ursula soon realizes she is immersed in treachery, murder at her heels. Lively period intrigue supplies subplots as well as the main story; Ursula is quick and brave but also a woman of her times, and the setting is vivid, brutal and atmospheric even to the contrasting feel of the countryside between France and England."

Birthmothers feel more secure in their decision because they have fairly regular letters/pictures delivered to them, showing them that their child is healthy and happy. The adoptive parents virtually never have to answer their childs questions about the adoption with ""I don't know"" and the adopted child doesn't have to wonder where he/she is from and why they were ""given up."" This was the most wonderful book that my husband and I read - and we have read a lot (b/c, by the way, my husband is also adopted, but with a closed adoption).

Parsley,0.5454545454545454,5,1209945600,Liberal Myth Shattered,"This extraordinary book offers the most complete and well researched history of Fascism over the past century and into the present day. This documented history blows away the myth that Fascism is a right wing movement and shows how this myth was devised originally by the communists to separate themselves from Hitler's Germany. This idea has survived today through the efforts of leftists and communists who want to disassociate themselves with the tactics of the third Reich. However, on closer examination, Goldberg makes the case that rather than being opposites, Communism and Fascism are close cousins. When you omit the Holocaust and the millions of murders committed under Hitler's Fascistic rule, you find that the socialism that Hitler expounded and the tactics he used were simply mirrored from the Communist rule under Stalin. In fact, untold numbers of individuals were murdered, starved, and imprisoned under the Soviet dictator but not nearly as much attention has been paid to those atrocities as with Hitler's.Goldberg breaks the common belief that Fascism has always been reviled in America. This is far from the truth. Fascism (along with communism) was actually admired back in the thirties and Mussolini, the father of the movement was admired by many. Even Hitler was admired at first, and only during and after the war and the atrocities exposed, was Hitler seen for the evil that he was and only then was Fascism seen as corrupt, racist, and totally evil form of government. On the other hand, the far left has never demonized the communists as they have the nazis. But communist dictators like Castro, Chavez, and Mao were all cut from the same cloth as Hitler.Most on the far left, would never admit that the tactics they used in the sixties were the very same used in Hitler's Germany. In fact the hippies of the sixties were nothing new. Italy had their own hippies in the twenties, and Germany their own in the thirties. The youth revolt, the rejection of their parents values, the call for unity, elevation of the common good, and violence, perpetuated in the effort to remake society for the better. All these have their roots in Socialist movements whether in Stalin's Russia, Mussolini's Italy or Hitler's Germany. The rejection of God and the move to replace Him with the State is common to all far left movements including Hitler's Germany.The right calls for small government, individual responsibility, low taxes, and respect for traditional values such as religion, respect for parents and authority. The right believes in rewarding hard work, and encouraging entrepreneurial enterprise, not penalizing success with high taxes and redistributing the wealth. The propaganda machine that has us believe that Fascism is a movement of the right just doesn't fit with the facts.If you are interested in historical truth, and want to understand what is going on inside the far left today from the perspective of history, there is no better book than Jonah Goldberg's book, Liberal Fascism."

They are not easy to read, though *Light in August* is the easiest of the three. The prose is so difficult at times that I needed to reread again and again. I had to stop and take numerous breaks because my brain got twisted around.I strongly suggest getting research materials from a university librray if at all possible to help navigate the stories. In the end, the depth of these novels is profound and extremely rewarding. It was only after I finished them (and read a lot of extra research articles) that I truly appreciated them. These novels are definitely amazing and a great account of southern life in the early part of the 20th century (and after the civil war), and I admire Faulkner more than I ever thought I could.If you thought James Joyce was complex, try Faulkner!"

It was hard for me to believe that some people were so cruel to animals, but I loved the book's old-fashioned narration and of the adventures of and lessons learned by Miss Laura and her family in raising Joe. The moment I learned what the word ""abridged"" meant, I went looking for the complete story; it took me a long time to find this Applewood Books edition that included three of the farm chapters that were missing from the supposedly complete version I later purchased, and oddly, the Applewood edition is missing the chapter about the crow that is in some other editions. (I believe this is because the Applewood volume is a reprint of the original story and the chapter about the crow was added in a revised edition.) The story is full of memorable characters, both animal--Joe, Jim the spaniel, Billy the fox-terrier, Bella the parrot--and human--Miss Laura, Ned, Willie, Jack, and Cousin Harry. If you are tender of heart, you may find many scenes heart-rending, but it reminds us too that we have much to still work on in the area of animal cruelty."

0595658857,The Never Ending Pigeon Saga,23.95,ASWC1ELL22UOA,Calvin Toren,1,1,1101859200,A literary disgrace.,"If you read the various other reviews written on this novel, you will most likely see a very polarized reaction- the readers of this particular saga seem completely divided between utter loathing and fervent admiration. Many of the exorbitantly positive opinions expressed here state that this particular novel was written for a younger, internet-savvy demographic, one less concerned with literary convention and more with humor and colloquialism. One could indeed make an argument that many of the great novelists were either disliked or unnoticed in their respective times, but I sincerely doubt Mr. Blizzurd lies amongst their ranks. The humor described in many of these customer reviews is that of the lowest common demonminator, forgoing all semblance of wit or irony in favor of an almost shameful crudeness. Another of this novel's virtues, as described by its supportive reviewers, alludes to the idea that this novel is written without typical literary conventions, and in doing so appeals to a broad audience through conversationalism. But to venerate a novel based on its lack of complexity, for its stereotypical and unrealistic characters, abandonment of a cohesive, coherent, or even entertaining plot, its use of simplistic language and its many other faults is simply a testament to how bad modern times have become. Though I acknowledge this is meant to be a satire, a parody of the lifestyle lead by the novel's protagonist (I use this term loosely here), that does not excuse it from being poorly-written and indescribably exploitative; all the humor and mass appeal in the world cannot redeem this shameful profiteering venture. A novel such as this one exemplifies everything wrong with modern literature, and it is a shame that this author has received publication while many other credible, talented writers remain unpublished, unread, and unappreciated. I do agree with many of the positive reviewers who state that reading should be entertaining, yet I certainly hope that the public does not need a book this low, this disgraceful, this terribly written and shallow in order to find reading attractive. This book has only two purposes, both tinly-veiled: as [...] material poorly passed off as literature, and as a perfect example of how the modern American novel has declined so steeply over the years.This book is an abomination, and to purchase it is to fill the coffers of its untalented, profiteering, shameless author, and to contribute to a lamentable trend in modern American literature. You're all smarter than this; do not sell yourselves short with this novel. If you have the capacity to read this website, you have the capacity to appreciate literature far greater than this, and I fully urge you all to do so.Thank you."

While this work was NOT a book in which to search for a proper ethical analysis, NY Times reporter Gina Kolata provided a wonderfully readable narrative of cloning ""science"" up to ""Dolly."" I was particularly struck by certain of her inclusions:* ""Marie Antoinette Di Berardino, a serious woman who was a cloning pioneer, and who had been studying cloning in frogs since the 1950s, said she could imagine nothing that would justify cloning a human being: 'I'm coming from a Roman Catholic background, and I'm telling you, it' killing me,' she said. 'We have lost so much respect for human life in so many ways. I just have a fear that this may be taking a step too far'"" (pp. 36, 37).* ""The early days of embryology were the days of the gentlemen scientists, dressed formally in coats and vests, and priding themselves on their worldly interests....those early embryologists sought the company and the comments of other great thinkers and purposely tried to envision their work in a philosophical context. Science and philosophy, in fact, were intermingled to such an extent that, [Washington University developmental biologist David] Kirk said, 'no serious scientist would think of publishing his results without trying to draw philosophical conclusions from them.' These scientists took the title Doctor of Philosophy very seriously. For much of the 19th century & in the early part of the 20th century, science was actually called natural philosophy. And 'at least until Darwin's time, a majority of biologists thought that what they were doing was elucidating God's handiwork, approaching the mind of God by studying His creations,' Kirk said"" (pp. 48, 49).* ""The ethics movement had its roots in real scandals and moral dilemnas of teh late 1960s and early 1970s....IN order to develop a vaccine for Hepatitis B, doctors had purposely infected mentally retarded [sic] children at the Willowbrook State Hospital in Staten Island with the liver virus....The study eventually resulted in a vaccine against this incurable disease, but the damage to the public's perception of the morals of scientists was done....Once again, it seemed [sic], the weakest and most vulnerable were being used by scientists to advance their careers"" (pp. 77, 78).* President Clinton asked his National Bioethics Advisory Commission to respond to cloning's ethical and legal ramifications. At that time, the commission was chaired by Princeton University President Harold Shapiro. It was this same Harold Shapiro who picked Peter Singer for an endowed ethics chair at Princeton. Unbelievably, Peter Singer has maintained that human parents should be allowed to kill their newborns - up to several months. If the chair of this commission could pick such an individual for an endowed ethics chair, what sort of ""credibility"" could the commission of that era possibly claim? AS per Kolata, ""the commission's final report suggested banning only the cloning of cells from people who had already been born, leaving the door open to many of the possibilities that the infertility doctors [sic] envisioned"" (p. 244).* ""Steen Willadsen...[was a] Danish scientist who was the first to clone a sheep from a sheep embryo cell"" (p.129). The follow three sentences of Kolata's text are as follows: ""In the end, it may come down to a matter of semantics, Willadsen told me. Yes, he is pretty sure that humans will be intentionally cloned one day. But, he said, 'it probably will not be called cloning' (p.248).As the Vatican's 2008Instruction Dignitas Personae on Certain Bioethical Questions,""Cloning is proposed for two basic purposes:reproduction....Therapeutic cloning...has been proposed as a way of producing embryonic stem cells with a predetermined genetic patrimony in order to overcome the problem of immune system rejection; this is therefore linked to the issue of the use of stem cells....""Human cloning is intrinsically illicit in that, by taking the ethical negativity of techniques of artificial fertilization to their extreme, it seeks to give rise to a new human being without a connection to the act of reciprocal self-giving between the spouses and, more radically, without any link to sexuality. This leads to manipulation & abuses gravely injurious to human dignity....""If cloning were to be done for reproduction....The fact that someone would arrogate to himself the right to determine arbitrarily the genetic characteristics of another person represents a grave offense to the dignity of that person as well as to the fundamental equality of all people....""From the ethical point of view, so-called therapeutic cloning is even more serious. To create embryos with the intention of destroying them, even with the intention of helping the sick, is completely incompatible with human dignity, because it makes the existence of a human being at the embryonic stage nothing more than a means to be used and destroyed. It is gravely immoral to sacrifice a human life for therapeutic ends."""

Have you been bezel setting stones and are now ready to advance to a prong setting? Ready to make a hinge? Casting? Fusing? Repouss&eacute;? Need to know what the Precious Metal Clay craze is about and how to start? It's all in here and the information is presented in a format made for the beginner or the experienced jeweler.

I keep this book handy on my shelf, and so far I haven't been disapointed.

The over two hundred letters cover almost any type of letter you will have to write as a business person. I would have given the book 4.5 stars if it was possible, but I chose not to give it five stars because I would expect a book on business letters in today's day and age to now include at least some information on e-mail letters, or letters written in the context of e-commerce. I think that if the author came out with an equivalent book for writing e-mails or business letters for people in e-commerce situations, or perhaps made an addition to this book, it would provide important additional resources to the average user given the popularity of new internet technologies. Otherwise the book is excellent, and I highly recommend it for anyone who wants a quick reference and guide to writing business letters!"

Perfect material for the secret police.As I read the end of the book, I began to felt great. John Sack brought the humaneness of these people into perspective.

Hannah is introduced to a man named Matthew at the age of eight and told that he is her father. Immediately after being handed into his care, much to his wife's dismay, Hannah's biological mother dies. Hannah then proceeds to grow up in a household fraught with tension and hate.. mostly coming from her stepmother and one sibling. Thankfully, there is boarding school and off she goes. Upon finishing school, however, her father dies as a result of a scandalous situation. Now left in her vindictive stepmother's care, Hannah has only two choices: Marry the local butcher or hit the streets. What Hannah doesn't know is that there is another option in the form of Ned, who has loved her since she was a child.She marries Fred and I must say, never gives him a fair chance. Throughout her entire marriage, she decides (finally!!) that she wants to be with Ned and despite the vows she exchanged with Fred, she sees Ned on the sly. Obviously, Hannah is not always a likeable character nor easy to sympathize over. I did, however, like all the scandal and there was quite a bit keeping me on the edge of my seat. The only thing keeping me from enjoying this to a 5 star fullest is how spineless Hannah is in the first three fourths of the novel. Only in the end, does this gal show some real spunk and what a surprise she pulls out of her apron! Had she been so ballsy in the first few parts, I would have enjoyed it more."

It is for that reason that his work is so filled with countless paradoxes and contradictions that challenge the mind and titillate the senses. Wilde lived in an infinitely ironic age, when society had grown so influential as to crowd out the individuals that made it up. Today, we have taken for granted this incongruity and so our writers cannot express the kind of irony that Wilde mastered, despite the fact that we all know that something is amiss.`The Picture of Dorian Gray' is filled with this irony. The plot shows us the ultimate irony of a man giving up his soul for the beauty of youth--the condition that is exalted in the modern age above all else, intellect, truth, justice, life itself. Interspersed are dialogues and epigrams that persist one hundred years later as some of the finest word handling ever recorded. Even a few samples should compel the potential reader:""The only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about.""""Every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not of the sitter.""""A man cannot be too careful in his choice for his enemies.""""The only difference between a caprice and a life-long passion is that the caprice lasts a little bit longer.""""Men marry because they are tired, women marry because they are curious. Both are disappointed.""""I love acting, it is so much more real than life.""- ""I am on the side of the Trojans, they fought for a woman.""- ""They were defeated.""The mastery of wit that Wilde displays must be seen in its context. He was a decadent as much as the characters he portrays are. Ultimately, the disillusion that the decadent faces comes through in the story and the reader is left with a very uneasy feeling upon completing `Dorian Gray.' Is life as absurd as it seems? Is there a solution? Or are we stuck with a life of paradox? Perhaps our current period of decadence will show us an alternative. Until it does, we can enjoy the astounding word play offered here."

I also thought this would be an accessible way for them to get oriented to English literature and prepare them for further reading.The requirements of the Christmas Carol book to be purchased were that a) it be new as opposed to a ragged used copy, b) it be unabridged, c) it have good drawings; and d) if possible it be inexpensive. I first looked in the library, but their book was checked out, and anyway I was looking to start a family tradition of reading the story every year with our own copy if possible. The Candlewick Press edition with illustrations by P.J. Lynch appeared to fill the bill; I bought it; and it delivered the goods. The book is nice and readable-sized, the illustrations good, the type pleasing. Thirteen bucks. I was immensely satisfied with the purchase.As to the fate of the reading, we handled one chapter per evening, there being five chapters; each took an hour or so to read. I found Dickens to be sometimes heavy going for the younger TV and video-generation kids to get a sense of what is going on. I did not recollect Dickens to be so when I read some of his works as a younger person, but apparently it's something you have to be exposed to and get to understand. Anyway I was happy to provide my children with the chance to get started. It gave me a measure of the gap between the reading preparation of today's youth versus my pre-Cambrian elementary and middle school days. On Christmas Day I showed them the George C. Scott version of the movie, and they all liked it. But all knew the basics from the book, which was my goal, even if the mid-1800s prose obscured many of the action points to the younger ones in their Sponge Bob and Hannah Montana mindsets.So the effort was a success, and this edition of the book did what I had hoped by delivering up an excellent presentation at a very low cost.Dan of Arlington"

Her sister, twenty years older, is Mother Superior. The convent is a place of religious devotion, days filled with prayer and service, farm work and quiet times devoted to the arts of keeping house. There is study for the postulates. It is a quiet life, a contemplative life. Everyone is part of the flow.Then comes Mariette and gradually the peace is disturbed. Not intentionally, mind you. Gradually. For you see, Mariette's palms begin to bleed, her feet bleed, her side bleeds. She goes into trances. Stigmata? Here in our simple cloister? Why would God visit such a miracle on us here in this obscure place?Ron Hansen has written a book of sublime faith, or is it faith? The prose is as lush and beguiling as Mariette's young body. He creates a kind of word art, designing his sentences to resemble single lines of nuns going into the choir loft, outside in the fields, going to the barn, picking grapes.Gorgeous prose takes away your breath: ""Horsetails of gray smoke rise from the candles at Vespers."" ""Blood scribbles down her wrists and ankles and scrawls like red handwriting on the floor."" ""She hears firewood wheezing and thudding apart inside the iron stove."" ""Easy water rustles over stones beneath a Queen Anne's lace of ice.""The hush of deception begins early. Again, wordsmith Hansen provides just a few lines at a time suggesting support of stigmata or its deception. The reader is held in quietly building suspense. This is a cloister. Expect no car chases here.That is all I can tell. Oh, one more thing. The last paragraph, the very last paragraph holds the key. The ending is absolutely stunning.

In fact, any scientist who says otherwise is rather disingenuous. Science is all about questioning pre-existing knowledge. That's how it grows and, with observation, experimentation and logical reasoning, is part of how new knowledge is acquired. That's what Charles Darwin, Albert Einstein and anyone else who has made scientific discoveries did. There is a point however where the questioning continuously leads to the same conclusion, which is the point where concepts such as evolution and relativity are now. Where creationists/intelligent designers fail is in assuming that simply raising questions provides evidence to the contrary of what you are questioning. It does not. If there is an ""intelligent designer"" you need to do more than simply point out that there are aspects of evolutionary biology where further research is needed. What you have to do is provide research that provides evidence for any alternative that you propose. Simply raising questions is not enough. You need to provide evidence for an alternative claim. Without such evidence, creationism cannot be considered science, and thus, has no place in a science classroom. Furthermore, you must be willing to subject yourself to - and to encourage - the same process of questioning of your ideas. I am a Christian who has no problem with this. I don't need to lie to children to keep my faith strong. I don't need to confuse them about what constitutes scientific knowledge. I can accept that evolution is the way God created the world. Why He has chosen to do it that way is for Him to know. I don't trust anyone who says they know what God thinks. I don't trust anyone, such as this author, who feels he has to mislead people about scientific knowledge in order to have faith in God."

I would expect no less from two successful professional women running the fast track in New York City circa 2000.If you're the romantic type, (like my wife) the portrayal of the relationships between the main characters and their mates are realistic and very well done.Even though I'm not from New York the vivid descriptions from chapter to chapter made me feel like I was part of their posse.There was just enough suspense,action and sex (the sex scenes are HOT!....and I do mean HOT!) to allow me to breeze through ""Revenge"" in no time (took me two days.....).My wife started reading ""Revenge"" last night and she can't put it down.If you're looking for an escape from the tension of today's world events,I would highly recommend that you RUN (don't walk....) to your nearest bookseller and pick up ""Revenge"" right away!You won't be disappointed!"

It centers on life among the Inuit in settlements north of Baffin Island. Their living arrangements & diet are of particular interest. Foods such as 'blood pudding' are mentioned, and also the unusual talent of 'throat singing'.As the niece of an Antarctic explorer who died in an igloo while doing climate studies for the government in 1950s, I am curious to know why a Horn Book reviewer described Theodore Taylor's book as ""a routine survival story""! That has to be an oxymoron? Some tales of discovery may suffer from excess 'embroidery' but Taylor has authored a winner that will reach an audience far wider than the targeted middle graders. (In a different way Andrew Revkin's book ""The North Pole Was Here"" - #0753461382 - shows how global warming has caused drastic changes in the Arctic Circle).Two young boys find themselves adrift on a narrow floe in the Greenland Strait after an iceberg breaks loose. Just staying alive is their aim but to somehow draw attention of rescuers competes for top attention. Ten year old Sulu peppers his older brother Alika, asking anxiously about what their parents might be doing at that moment, or, questioning how long it will take before someone sees them float by. Taylor's descriptions of the brothers show them deeply anxious for each other's welfare; Alika, who becomes fifteen during the long ordeal, is especially sensitive to Sulu's different personality and interests.Decades later we are asking how these people & their culture have survived arrogance and power grabs, as well as all the environmental mistakes that have been made, primarily by governments and corporations. Taylor's book ""ICE DRIFT"" is not about a government's inhumanity (as described in Melanie McGrath's ""The Long Exile"" - #0007157975) but is a tale of boys adapting to the worst circumstances imaginable with courage and fortitude, drawing faith from what their Shaman has taught.In Capatin Thierry Mallett's book (""Plain Tales of the North - #B00008639AE, published in 1925 & 1925) a similar quandary is faced by two even younger brothers. Both stories may have been inspired by an incident recorded in 1868. Moving at a fast momentum these tales will grip your interest and propel readers to satisfying conclusions. This reader/reviewer gives each high marks and will soon be recommending more books, and films, on the exciting subject of ""poles apart""."

Luckily, the Dark Hunters and most of the other immortals can remember him, as well as anyone in his direct bloodline. Unfortunately for him, there is only 1 member of his blood line left and he is extremely over protective of him. When he meets Cassandra, a woman who can actually remember him, he starts to have some rather erotic dreams about her. Cassandra is having the same dreams and they are feeling a little too real for her. Wulf wonders if these dreams could be happening for real in an alternate dream realty and finds himself very intrigued with Cassandra. As he soon finds out, she turns out to be the heiress to a cursed race. This race is destined to die at the age of 27 unless they kill and take in human souls to remain alive as Daimons. The Dark Hunters were born to hunt Daimons and this makes their situation a touchy one. If she becomes a Daimon, it will be Wulf's job to hunt her down and kill her, but if she doesn't she will die a very painful death on her next birthday. Just to mix things up a little, there is of course lots of interference from the gods too.I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The inner struggles with Wulf and Cassandra were intense and definitely gave us a deeper look into the lives of the Apollites and Daimons. So far, we've thought that all Daimons were bad, but as it turns out it's not quite so cut and dry. As usual we got more information to piece together about Acheron. I really can't wait for his book, that is one mysterious and intriguing man (and I use the term man very loosely). With so many Dark Hunter books, I was afraid when I started that they would all blend together but that surely has not been the case. Sherrilyn Kenyon continues to find unique stories to take each of these Dark Hunters on. I like that we get some reoccurring characters from book to book as well. I really liked Wulf but there were a lot of new characters in this book that we hadn't met before that I really liked too. I'll be intrigued to see where Ms. Kenyon takes us in the next book when we see a little more into the Were-hunters too."

0131872788,A Brief Tour of Human Consciousness: From Impostor Poodles to Purple Numbers,10.17,A3VKSHNFTWTCD2,"Siamak Hejabian, B.S.",,5,1355184000,Mind-Blowing Explanations Behind Neurological Mysteries,"The book A Brief Tour of Human Consciousness: From Impostor Poodles to Purple Numbers written by Dr. Ramachandran is easy to read and understand for people with a range of scientific knowledge. The author explains a variety of neurological conditions in a very simple manner. Dr. Ramachandran has published many books such as Phantoms in the Brain: Probing the Mysteries of the Human Mind, The Encyclopedia of the Human Brain, and more than 120 articles about his research of the brain. His findings have opened up many doors toward better understanding of this simple-looking but also most complicated organ in the entire world, the human brain. The author in this book provides simple yet satisfying explanations for the cause of many seemingly complicated and challenging neurological conditions such as capgras delusion, phantom limb syndrome, and synesthesia.The author covers a wide spectrum of topics within the book's five chapters, but two recurring themes run through all of them. The first broad theme is that by studying neurological syndromes, we can acquire novel insights into the functions of the normal brain and learn how the normal brain works. For example, patients with capgras syndrome hold a delusion that a friend, a pet or a family member has been replaced by an identical-looking impostor. Dr. Ramachandran in this book explains that a neuronal connection between vision and emotion is cut since these patients do not experience the syndrome when they only hear their family member's voice. Examples and explanations similar to the capgras syndrome prove the existence of the first theme throughout the book. The second theme is that scientists can use evolution as a tool in understanding brain function. For instance, the author proposes laughter as nature's signal for ""okay,"" and he provides a mechanism for it by explaining that humans laugh when the anterior cingulate, a part of the brain, does not receive potentially dangerous signals.What does an amputee who still feels a phantom limb have in common with an avant-garde artist, or a schizophrenic who claims to be controlled by alien implants, or an autistic child who can draw a hyper-realistic horse? According to the author, the answer lies deep in the physical structures of the brain, and this book offers a thought-provoking survey of his area of research. Through examples, anecdotes and conjecture, Ramachandran aims to make neuroscience more accessible to a broad audience by providing simple explanations. In this book he succeeds admirably, explaining how the roots of both psychological disorders and aesthetic accomplishment can be located in the various regions of the brain and the connections (or lack thereof) between them.Explaining interesting conditions such as the phantom limb syndrome makes this book a unique source of information for people who want to find out more about them. Dr. Ramachandran devised mirror therapy to help amputees suffering from phantom limb pain, an agonizing experience in which patients feel pain in their missing limbs. By placing a mirror to reflect the existing limb in a position that makes it look like the missing one, the brain's distorted image of the phantom can be changed. When the amputee moves the existing limb into a comfortable position, the reflection in the mirror, the phantom limb, seems to move with it, and pain in that missing limb often disappears, sometimes forever. Some powerful techniques and treatments such as this are included in this book to give the readers an insight into today's advanced therapies in treating neurological conditions.This book provides a plausible explanation for mysterious conditions such as synesthesia, a condition in which multiple senses are activated with a stimulus that is perceived. The author most specifically focuses on color synesthesia, in which viewing black and white numbers on a page evokes the experience of seeing different colors. Based on his previous work on phantom limbs, Ramachandran suggested that synesthesia may arise from a cross-activation between brain regions. In this book he explains that color synesthesia is caused by hyperconnectivity between color and number areas at different stages in processing. For instance, patients with lower level of synesthesia may have cross-wiring (or cross-activation) within the fusiform gyrus (a structure in the temporal lobe of the brain), whereas patients with higher level of synesthesia may have cross-activation in the angular gyrus (a structure in the parietal lobe of the brain). I strongly believe that these types of discoveries and explanations are what make this book a unique source of information for readers interested in neuroscience.Towards the end of his book, Dr. Ramachandran provides a summary of previous chapters as well as discusses how some neuroscience phenomena might relate to some of philosophy of mind questions about free-well, self-awareness, and qualia, while simultaneously predicting that some major changes will take place in the future of science. However, the author never directly answers any philosophical questions, but rather opens up the discussion and leaves it up to the readers to decide whether neuroscience or philosophy has been most beneficial to people. He also believes that by observing what has happened in the past, he can predict that there will be major changes taking place in the field of science, especially neuroscience. I believe that the author, in this section, is trying to persuade his audience to keep up with future research and publications in neuroscience.A Brief Tour of Human Consciousness: From Impostor Poodles to Purple Number is an excellent book that provides much insight into several mysterious neurological conditions. Dr. Ramchandran includes observations and discoveries derived from his own direct interactions with his patients. Readers will find it very interesting and pleasing to see how simple explanations and mechanisms can make the understanding of complicated neurological conditions an easy task for people regardless of their scientific knowledge. The author is very optimistic that there will be many new discoveries about the human brain and its amazing power, and encourages the reader to learn about them. I have added this book to my collection of best scientific books, and I am very positive that you will do the same after reading it."

Sometimes, it makes the barrier seem so large that it is impossible to get through. Martin instead focuses on the underlying health of the church in transition and gives practical advice for increasing overall church health, structure, and thought processes. It also focuses on the stress of living in a transitional sized (140-225) church environment.Martin takes a real look at this dynamic without the pep talk mentality of many other resources."

He includes both common and rare recipes. For example, my 13 year old son and I made a raspberry/red currant/port wine sauce for chicken.I have used Bittman's book to make my own stocks which are flavorful and so superior to canned stocks, that I will never be able to return to the cans.The recipes are complete and organized in a way that makes preparing the ingredients ahead of time logical.Most inportant for me is the honesty of the descriptions. I have never found another cookbook that does not underestimate preparation time to make the recipe appear easier. Bittman's descriptions are extremely accurate.The book is also very well illustrated with pictures that actually show how the preparation should proceed. For example, he shows how to truss a chicken, but then explains how unnecessary the whole trussing is.And finally, he includes great recipes that you would need three books to find otherwise.

It doesn't -- in fact, the book contains hardly a shred of policy discussion, except that you're expected to be broadly familiar with what liberals/progressives stand for. Instead, the book deals with the strategy and tactics needed to put progressives back into power, not just by winning elections but by recapturing the hearts and minds of the people who used to vote solidly Democratic but who now either vote Republican or don't vote at all. And again, because the authors are successful bloggers, you'd expect that their focus would be on using the netroots to get the message out. In fact, this is only one theme among many. The most surprising thing about the book for me was the savage attacks on the Democratic party establishment and its constituent groups. They point out that, far from being a ""big tent"", Democrats are too much like a loosely coupled group of single-interest blocs, who will desert the party in a second if their pet issue isn't tended to the exact way they want it to be. The authors point out how ultimately self-defeating this strategy is, and note that the best way to get progressive legislation passed is to elect more Democrats, even if a few of them don't toe the party line on every issue. They save some of their harshest criticism for Democratic party consultants, who they argue are an entrenched class who make money even if their candidate fails, and thus have no motivation to work for victory. They argue (as others have argued before) that in order to confront the Republicans successfully, there has to be an infrastructure in place consisting of media, think tanks, and grassroots organizations in every state (in other words, the netroots is not enough, not even close). I was particularly interested in the fact that Republicans take much better care of their interns at think tanks than Democrats do; the latter seem to feel that doing something good for society should be payment enough. This is yet another example of the many layers of self-defeating behaviors that have turned the Democratic party into a shadow of its former self. Finally, the authors call for Democrats to be proud of who they are and to stand up forcefully for their values, because people would much rather vote for a real Democrat than for a lite Republican.Even though I follow the political scene very closely and read blogs every day, most of the information in _Crashing the Gates_ was new to me, and I think that all politically-minded readers who care about the future of progressive politics in this country will find it a fascinating read, even if they don't always agree with all of Jerome and Markos' prescriptions."

Madeiros' voice is amazingly crisp and easy to read. Writers frequently will find themselves thinking ""gee, I wish I'd written that,"" yet the refreshing turns of phrase, wit, and subtle employment of literary devices never get in the way of the story.From hero and heroine to every minor player, the characters fairly spring off the page. All are complex and enchanting in their own way. The hero and heroine are the kind of folks who stand out in a crowd without ever seeming to be too good to be true or too stupid to live. The Darling gang is a delightfully inept bunch with a volatile edge. One wonders how they ever managed to survive -- much less create a dangerous reputation for themselves -- since they all seem more like overgrown wayward boys than outlaws. The lawmen are rife with their own moral ambiguities, and the wealthy are as bereft in their own way as the downtrodden. The ""working girls"" are just slutty enough to be fun, but not so slutty as to be sleazy. Even the dogs, cats, horses, and mules have their foibles and blessings. Despite all the complexities of character, everyone's various parts seem to fit him or her, never leaving readers wondering ""why did he/she do that?""It's worth noting that for all her admirable skill, Madeiros indulges -- gleefully, almost -- in a couple of authorly ""sins"" about which contemporary fiction writers are warned ad nauseam. Point of view slides all over the place with reckless abandon. Adverbs barge in without even bothering to knock. Historical accuracy evidently felt the need of frequent coffee breaks. It's a testament to Madeiros' storytelling ability that none of those things do more than whisper in the back of a reader's mind before retreating in the face of the pure joy of immersion in the tale.NOBODY'S DARLING is highly entertaining. To descend into moribund cliche: Readers will laugh, they'll cry, they'll wish the story never would end."

0813340810,The Tao Of War,16.95,A2I00PHYAXRIDV,S. Wenz,0.9166666666666666,3,1120089600,Buyer beware: not for everyone.,"I purchased this book because, as the cover states, it seemed to be the perfect companion to Sawyer's excellent translation of the Art of War. I'm afraid that claim isn't very accurate. On the surface this book does appear quite promising--Sawyer has translated ninth-century commander Wang Chen's commentary on the classic Tao Te Ching and has even retranslated the source text itself; and a Taoist-military perspective on the nature of combat and conflict is certainly enough to catch one's attention. The historical importance and timelessness of the matter treated provide further value to the work.So why only 3 stars? Well, my first problem involves the organization of this book. Sawyer provides an introduction to Wang's commentary in which he briefly addresses historical details and the purpose of composition, and then moves on to address certain salient issues within the text. I found this introduction basically worthless, however. Sawyer appears to be merely going through the motions here--his scholarship in this introduction is lacking compared to what he did with the Art of War--and much of the introductory text consists of quotes and summaries from the pages to come. In other words, it offers little new insight; if you're going to be looking at extensive quotations, why not just read the book itself? I realize that criticizing the introduction usually doesn't offer much information about the text as a whole, but in this case I believe it does. I say this because the book follows a format of Tao Te Ching > Wang Chen > Sawyer, with each offering an interpretation of the previous one. So the issue here is a trait characterizing the entire work: we see Lao-Tzu's original Tao Te Ching text, which is then interpreted in a military- or government-centered nature by Wang, whose commentaries are then either explained or expanded upon by Sawyer. This is no bad thing, and within the book proper the translator shows his extensive knowledge of the material. Nonetheless, I don't see why this would be of value to the average reader (toward whom the book is obviously aimed). Wang provides a unique reading of the Tao Te Ching, but what it seems we have here is primarily multiple layers of commentary that come off as, well, filler. And that's my main reason for the low rating. Not much here seems essential to understanding the text: it's nothing other than multiple commentaries on a single source and there really isn't a need for extensive explanation. Sawyer does his best to work with what's there, but honestly, what's there isn't very interesting. Much is written but not much is actually said.I have a hard time envisioning this book being necessary for greater appreciation of either Sun-Tzu's Art of War or the nature of conflict in general. Sawyer's translation of the Art of War is ostensibly geared toward the business-politics world, and the Tao of War masquerades as a perfect complement to Sawyer's previous successful translation. I fail to agree with that assertion. With a more scholarly introduction and wider scope, this book could be quite useful to students of Chinese philosophy or military history, or to those eager to read new interpretations of the Tao Te Ching. It does not, however, strike me as successful when one considers its purpose; it comes off as an attempt to capitalize upon the commercial success of Sawyer's other books. The cover in particular emphasizes this: no mention is made of Wang Chen, only Sawyer's name appears on the front, and what is a mostly unrelated book is made to resemble the Art of War. This may work comercially (as well as follow classic military principles of deception) but I find it rather misleading for the average consumer.So, to conclude: if you're deeply interested in Chinese military history, I would recommend this book as a supplement to your studies. If you enjoyed the applicability of Sawyer's Art of War and are looking for something along the same lines, well, you won't find it here, and I recommend you to look elsewhere. Still curious? Buy it used if you must. It shouldn't be too difficult to find unwanted copies."

I didn't find much information on building VB Database Applications as web abled applications (where VB programming is heading) and that I would say is probable the only negative thing I could say about it and I also felt their should be more information on using a different back end for the database (back end means - database management software programs like Oracle or Foxpro) that might be used in larger corporation databases. This book is also great for a refresher for currently working VB database programmers that use MS Access and VB. I recomend you have Visual Basic professional edition and MS Access when using this book. You'll find plenty of support through John Smiley and other students."

How about all the other happy housewives in America? Are you saying we are all stupid? And for K. Pieroni, if you were'so smart' you would know that Happy Housewives is a fun book and not Shakespeare.

1563893126,Preacher Vol. 2: Until the End of the World,12.23,ATBHMBQEC4063,Ron Tothleben (tothleben@hotmail.com),1,5,997574400,Best volume of the series,"&quot;Untill the end of the World&quot; (which collects #8-17) is in my personal opinion the best volume of the Preacher-series. It is well written, everything that happens does happen for a cause reveiled later (really good to see things fall into place and finding yourself go &quot;Oh, that's right indeed !&quot;), a little more light-hearted than the previous volume (which comes to the good of the story) and filled with bizar humor which makes it easy to keep in touch with everything that happens without getting the feeling you're reading something information-packed (because you DO get a lot to process all at once). Steve Dillons art is also elevated to a higher level and works great for the story (not saying that it didn't before, but now even more so). The action and gore are well illustrated without it taking the attention of the actual story too much. It never gets the upper hand.The storyline is basically divided in four parts: In the first part (#8-10), that continues from the final issue of the previous volume, we see Jesse and Tulip trying to figure out what to do next when people from Jesse's past suddenly catch up with them. Seeing how their future-perspectives have suddenly changed 180 degrees Jesse decides it's time to tell Tulip about his youth, growing up at Angelville, and about how and why he disappeared all of a sudden out of her life 5 years ago. This is really the best part of the book (if not the best part of the whole series). It's really good to read about the sick and disturbed people Jesse had to grow up with (both for humurous means as for cruelty. You get to see ways of 'raising' a kid you seriously never thought of before), and it's good to know how this tough man wound up being a preacher (the 5 year gap between now and his disappereance is totally cleared up here). The second part (#11,12) is about Jesse and Tulips thoughts returning to the here and now. Jesse gets a preach by a rather uncommon person which tells him to deal with it all, and so he does. Then (#13-16) follows the &quot;Hunters&quot; story-arc. Jesse and Tulip meet back up with Cassidy who's is currently living in the apartment of his deceased girlfriend. When Cassidy gets a hint of which people are to be held responsible for the girls death he, Jesse and Tulip go on their way to avenge her. A story that leads us to the house of Jesus the Sade, a decadent freak, who's good for a nice, humorfilled, but not very important storyline (what bugs me a little though is the sudden display of morals in this storyline while preacher is nothing like that for the rest. Falls a little out of place). What IS important in this storyline is that we first get to meet the underground-group &quot;The Grail&quot; and learn about their quest (which is really big in later volumes). It takes some attention to realize who is who and who is doing what and what for, but in the end it's worth it (AND neccesary to understand to get what's going on later). The book ends (#17) with an issue that is really an intro to the next book. It further explains what the Grail hopes to achieve over time and what Herr Star REALLY wants with it. Cassidy turns out to be a man of more honor than Tulip gave him credit for up till now.The biggest plus of the book is Ennis' further display of his typical humor which is far more present here than in the previous volume. This makes the book a constant laugh (although the events in it aren't really that humorous) and easy to follow (seeing how A LOT that is of importance later gets laid out here). People who liked &quot;Gone to Texas&quot; will love this book because it's even better"

Yes, the public school systems have problems and he defines his reasons from the standpoint of a school teacher through his 7 lesson concept as the reason for this failure. However, he never presents any concrete solutions to a lot of these problems. Personally going through the 1960's school system he describes, I can empathize with him through personal experience as a student, but I never felt that I was actually ""dumbed down"".His only solution seems to be a return to a pastoral life of the 19th century of self-education which is not going to happen, unless we have major catastrophe which will most likely take us all back to the Stone Age. He sees the sociological problems being caused by the school system instead of it being brought into the school from society in general.Maybe he should rewrite this book by presenting the real problems and coming up with realistic solutions. Charter schools and home schooling are a start. I am a believer in self-education, but this technique is not the only solution and in most cases will not work with the average person.If you read the forwards & introduction, you can get the whole concept of this book.I was not dissatisfied with this book, only found it lacking in presenting a well thought out problem & solution thesis."

That is certainly the case with this performance of ""A Christmas Carol"" by the irrepressible Jonathan Winters. He inhabits every character from Scrooge to his housekeeper to Tiny Tim, offering in his own incomparable manner the way he thinks each character would sound.Never has a Scrooge been meaner, a ghost more menacing or Tiny Tim more winning.

Rebecca Wells created a world of women of which I wanted to be a part. The friendship of Teensy, Neecie, Vivi, and Caro makes me nostalgic for a generation and I time that was gone long before mine. There is something about the south and the southern way of living that makes a northerner like myself envious. I don't know if it's a myth or if it actually does exist, but the pecan groves and the duck camp and the cajun flavor of life enchanted me and millions of others. Women everywhere wanted to have loyal, quirky, wonderful friends like the Ya Yas. The idea that readers could revisit these old friends in yet another book was a gift.But, as I read Ya Yas in Bloom I wasn't as enchanted. Yes, there are some charming parts to the story. Yes, you will fall in love with the Ya Yas and the petites all over again. But, it is such a brief visit. We only get little snippets into their lives, camera flashes of a scene here and there with no cohesion.

Galishoff ""drmlg""",,5,1142294400,The Agony of Unconfessed Guilt,"It is not as much about adultery as it is about the corruption of unconfessed and unforgiven sin. Adultery is simply a vehicle for the author to deliver the underlying message and compare the lives, minds and souls of two sinners and the secret they share. The writing is in the Puritan style which befits the time period and the mindset of the characters. Some have complained about the language as being outdated but this is not a valid concern. The book should be read as the author intended. The style becomes easy to read with exposure to other period works. The Puritans preached much about sin as the evil of evils and how it corrupted the entire being. The true scarlet letter is the one worn within that sears the soul and not the one worn without. Hester's sin leads to redemption. Her public humiliation and shame is simply a mirror of the sin hidden within the people she lives with. Her public punishment is an expression of other's fear of contamination by sin as self judgment turned outward. The error of the townspeople is in their hardness of heart in failing to pray and help bring the sinner home. Here, piety itself becomes religion rather than love of God and fellow man. Such outward piety without true love is a stumbling block to salvation and is paradoxically sinful. Shame and fear of public humiliation and becomming an outcast stands in the way of confession of sin and ultimately forgiveness and salvation. Hawthorne hangs the millstone around the neck of false and self-deceptive piety. This is timeless lesson and the stuff of great literature."

Elements of surprise, of creative newness are what for Pragmatists make the human future, history itself as a whole fundamentally unpredictable. Popper argues in this work that total theories such as Marxism which claim to contain within themselves the true course and outcome of history, are by their very nature, mistaken. A total predictability of history is impossible in part because the prediction itself effects the actors, but also because of unseen, and unforeseeable elements which come with our always imperfect knowledge. The position taken here by Popper is in consonance with his own defense of the Open Society, and human freedom- other major elements of his thought.Popper sees here a fundamental truth of the human situation."

Written by Scotswoman Elizabeth MacIntosh, who wrote under the pen name Josephine Tey, it was first published in 1951. It is tragic that the author died in 1952 and was never to know the pleasure that this book would bring to generations of readers and that the Mystery Writers of America would ultimately rank it fourth among the one hundred best mysteries ever written.The title of the book is derived from a historical source, as it is attributable to Sir Francis Bacon, ""For truth is rightly named after the daughter of time, and not of authority."" The book itself is not a traditional mystery but rather an application of deductive reasoning to an actual historical event. The event in question is the murder of the princes in the tower, sons of King Edward IV, allegedly by their uncle, Richard III, who eventually usurped the English throne after the death of his brother. It has been widely held that Richard III did, indeed, murder the two young princes, his nephews, in order to secure his claim to the throne.The reader is introduced to Scotland Yard Inspector Alan Grant, who is hospitalized and recovering from injuries sustained in the line of duty. While convalescing, he becomes intrigued by a picture of a portrait of Richard III, a likeness with which he is unfamiliar. Grant is puzzled that someone with such a sensitive face could have been such a monster as to murder his two nephews in cold blood. So, our intrepid Inspector decides that he will reconsider the evidence upon which such a dastardly assumption has been based. With the help of an American researcher doing the necessary legwork, Grant compiles enough archival historical fact that incrementally helps him formulate a new theory as to who actually may have murdered the princes in the tower.This analysis and reformulation is done as though it were being argued to a jury. Indeed, so persuasive is Inspector Grant through the application of some insightful deductive reasoning and clever dialogue that the reader comes away thinking that Grant has solved one of the most intriguing historical mysteries of all time. This is certainly an unusual book conceptually but one that succeeds brilliantly. It should appeal to those readers who enjoy having a mystery unraveled, as well as to those who harbor a love of English history. Bravo!"

Because they fail to adapt to changing demands by the public on evenhanded and impartial news.What I find amusing is how these public corporations with a Board of Directors with Corporate Auditors operate a losing business. When they try to make up the news instead of reporting the news and such losses take away from income elsewhere, then it time for lawsuits by shareholders. No doubt some creative Trial Lawyers will look into class actions lawsuits against such irresponsible Boards of Directors that permit these corporations to take losses when other turn a profit! And they dare criticize ""Enron"" when they have News Divisions burdening earnings due to the failure to attract and keep viewership, let alone pay huge salaries to News Readers!Second, it is time to also look at the advertisers with similar questions of responsibility to their shareholders. Can they not see that news with bias does not attract the viewers and thus they are wasting their dollars advertising on such programs? It is time advertiser start to look at how the news is hurting their businesses not promoting them by mutual incompetence, intentional bias, and a refusal to report both sides.Third, it is time for the media to pay its own way when gaining profits by using public resources. The People's Representatives from congressman to senators to agency heads to the cabinet to the president are taxpayer's employees. Yet, the media provides no compensation back to taxpayers as their newscasts and stories make money from the government. There should be a surcharge reimbursing the public treasury for private media making profits. They are no longer providing a public service nor do they have the public trusts. Only Non-profits should be exempt because they must be unbiased and non-political in all reporting and actions.Finally, I came away actually shocked by two things. The New York Times is perhaps the greatest abuser of the First Amendment by it failure to retract stories that proved to be embarrassing once all the facts. This can clearly be seen as the book points out on the New York Times Affirmative Action pieces on suspended medical licensed Doctor that they promoted before his suspension.And I was more shocked to see the fairness and outright candor of the Washington Post giving a favorable review of this book. Two prime example of why trust in the media has gone away but hope it can change for the better.If they will not change on there own, competition, lawsuits, and a failure to communicate with the public will make them or break them. Either way the public will win!"

While I cannot write with the authority of several other reviewers who are French, I found this book very interesting and helpful.It is, of course, extremely difficult to know what is important in other cultures without study or introduction. Our first visits to France were marked by occasional blunders and a more than a few misconceptions. However we enjoyed our experiences and returned often. Nadeau and Barlow have helped us understand what's going on behind those literally closed doors.Just as the French fail to understand why Americans think the way we do, we have no idea why certain things are important to them and others are meaningless. Sixty Million... helps break down the codes, deciphers the hieroglyphics and eases the burden of being immersed in another very foreign culture. There is so much that divides us! And yet we are all humans with the same basic needs and desires.I disagree strongly with the other reviewers who found Sixty Million... lacking. They wrote their reviews as insiders. Given their mission and goals, Nadeau and Barlow did a marvelous job of setting things into their proper places and patiently explaining, by examples and facts, French behavior. It is so very easy to criticize when you have made no attempt to undertake a similar project. I found no predication or prejudice toward America or France. The authors do a superb job of being objective.My only concern is that the authors explained the effects of World War II and the Algerian War without any analysis of the First World War and its effect on French history and living conditions. Every single village and town we visited has a monument listing their dead in the Great War. Almost one hundred years have passed and the French still suffer in many ways from that shocking carnage. The Great War set the stage for all that happened in the twentieth century; this seems to me to be a singular lapse of reporting.I very much enjoyed this book and highly recommend it."

1400079497,The Plot Against America,10.85,A6Y5R84GTS368,PuroShaggy,,3,1311379200,Roth goes political with mixed results,"""The Plot Against America"" finds Philip Roth stepping outside his comfort zone and getting a little too political when compared to his other work.The novel revolves around the historical rewrite that Charles Lindbergh, a documented Nazi sympathizer, runs for president and defeats FDR in the 1940 presidential election. As feared by Philip Roth's family and other politically aware Jewish citizens, Lindbergh begins to enact a series of laws that have the obvious desire of either assimilating or punishing the Jewish community. Philip's family lies at the heart of this struggle- torn apart by the desire to join the Lindbergh cause versus the desire to fight it- and embodies the struggle that minority and immigrant families undergo when living in a society where they are oppressed and viewed as lesser citizens.While one of Roth's goals with this novel is a giant What If?- what if Nazi sympathizers were in power during World War II?- it is Roth's other purpose- the one that defines Roth's success over the years- that ultimately makes this book rewarding. His description of a middle class, Jewish family living in America in the middle of the 20th century is what makes this book rewarding, and at times, hilarious. Roth's strength as a writer is the fearlessness in which he embraces and examines his heritage, and it is this aspect of the story that produces the most engaging work. When all is said and done, the ambitious plot involving Lindbergh and a shadow Nazi government seem too forced, and while undeniably interesting, Roth has overreached his comfort zone as a writer.While not one of Roth's better efforts, ""The Plot Against America"" is a unique re-write of American history and in many ways, relates to the ongoing struggles of minorities (i.e. muslims, immigrants) and their place in American society."

I have read all of Teresa's books, and I finished with Nobody's Darling. Every one of her books are great. I get so involved in them that I can easily read them in a day or two. Nobody's Darling was no exception. The tale of Esmerelda and Billy Darling is sweet, adventurous, funny, and romantinc. My favorite book is A Whisper of Roses, but Nobody's Darling is definately right up there with it. I recommend you go out and read this book...you might as well buy it because once you've read it you'll want to buy it. Actually, you might as well buy any book you read by her. She is such a good writer. She really knows how to get her readers to feel like they are in the story.Nobody's Darling is a western, but even if you don't like westerns you'll love this book...it's great! One of the things I love about Teresa's writing style is that she has you laughing and crying all through her books, and most of the time there are only a few love scenes. So, her books are not that lovey dovey like most romances. I never really liked romances, but once I read my first book by her (A Whisper of Roses) I was hooked. And let me tell you, her books never disappoint. They are all keepers! Take my advice and go pick up a copy of this book and read it yourself! You won't be sorry!"
0961519762,Tear Soup: A Recipe for Healing After Loss,14.36,AO96PLO6E3MJC,Grandma GG,,5,1292284800,One for our family's permanent library,"After reading the beautiful reviews on Amazon, I recently purchased Tear Soup for my 11-year old granddaughter when we knew the end was near for her aged dog. We gave her the book on the same day that her beloved pet died, and she has read it over and over again. She carries the book between her house and mine because it gives her comfort. This is a lovely story, well illustrated and clearly written about the feelings we experience when we face a big loss. While it empathizes with the raw feelings of fresh grief, it subtly and sensitively explains the stages of mourning and assures the reader that grieving is a process that we can get through in time. A psychologist friend is buying several copies for her office lending library because, although written for children, it is so beautifully done that adults will find great comfort in it. Since all of us face loss at one time or another, it is a good book to keep on hand. I recommend this book wholeheartedly for people of all ages."

But it's very completeness (over 400 large pages) made it intimidating.Now at last comes this pocket-sized abridgement, by the original authors.Today all too many Catholic apologetics books assume you're discussing the faith with evangelicals who are well-versed in Scripture. But the reality is that the non-religious (ranging from vaguely spiritual new-agers to uninformed agnostics to functional atheists) are at least as common in our society as &quot;Bible Christians&quot;.This is a perfect intro for Christians that need to respond with logic to objections and concerns about fundamental beliefs (God, moral law, miracles, the problem of pain, Jesus Christ). It's also great for those who want to see how classic Catholic reasoning &quot;stacks up&quot; to the modern world."

Moreta loves Orlith, her dragon queen, and would do anything for her, but she does wish that someone else had flown her during her mating flight. Sh'gall is a very able weyrleader in the air when fighting thread, but he does not do as well with people. Moreta is sure that they will go together to the Ruatha Gather, after all it is Lord Alessan's first gather as a Lord Holder and everyone will be there. However, Sh'gall decides to go to the Telgar Gather and to see the strange cat that was captured in the ocean and put on display there. Desdra, Moreta's anxious housekeeper insists that Moreta cannot go without Sh'gall and that it is a terrible slight to her mistress, but Moreta wouldn't miss a good gather for the world!Moreta has a wonderful time at the gather with Lord Alessan. They are both avid racers and enjoy watching the runnerbeasts compete. When one of the runnerbeasts suddenly collapses, no one is sure what is wrong with the beast, but the fun of the gather continues. Moreta lingers at Ruatha Hold, but is finally forced to leave. She is awoken in the early morning hours by a frantic Sh'gall claiming that Masterhealer Capiam has diagnosed a plague that the wild cat brought over with it from the Southern Continent. All of Pern is in a panic as news of the unknown illness spreads.All too soon there is no hold or weyr that is untouched by the unknown ailment. But Moreta is a healer and she is determined to help in whatever way she can. She continues to urge the dragonriders to take care and helps unite multiple weyrs to fly thread together, as well as help care for the sick and wounded. When Masterhealer Capiam finds a cure, Moreta is thrilled and ready to do whatever is necessary to give the vaccination to everyone on Pern before a second wave of the mutated virus spreads more death. She cannot understand why some weyrleaders simply refuse to see the truth and will not help take the medicine to the far-reaching holds. Moreta cannot bear to see people die unnecessarily so she secretly arranges for dragonriders from all the Weyrs to help. When part of her plan falls through, Moreta has no choice but to go and help deliver the vaccination herself. But she cannot rider her beloved Orlith because she is guarding her clutch. When she borrows her mentor's queen Holth, the tragedy begins...I enjoyed this book a lot more than I thought I would. I first heard of Moreta's Ride in Dragonsinger when Menolly leads the ballad with her fire lizards. I knew that this book was going to have a bittersweet ending, but I love the Pern series so I thought that I would give it a try. I thought that Moreta was a great character - strong, but not overpowering. She tried to make the best of her situation and found joy and love in unlikely places. I thoroughly enjoyed the romance between Moreta and Alessan, but I felt so sorry for Alessan for having to deal with so much tragedy and so many bitter disappointments when he was so young. I also enjoyed seeing the inner workings of a Weyr and becoming familiar with a Weyr other than Benden (much as I love it, of course). I thought that all of the secondary characters were wonderful, too. It was interesting to see how quickly knowledge was lost from when the first settlers arrived on Pern to the time of Moreta. I believe that the sickness was something like pneumonia or some other viral disease that few people die of on Earth, but they simply did not know how to combat any unfamiliar disease on Pern. The plot was very interesting and had a nice, smooth flow as always. Another wonderful addition to the Pern series!"

Some could be used, but most refer to things that are no longer in use, or to issues or items that we no longer have knowledge of. For instance, there are many words that refer to horses as a means of transportation--since we rarely use them in this manner, the words are not functional for our society.I would highly recommend this book to anyone with an interest in history or etymology, but not to those who, like me, are looking for words to add to their current vocabulary.

He is the creator of the game. She beats him in a sword fight and sexy highjinks ensue. The reason that I haven't said what the theme of the game is that the story itself is so generic that it could have been D & D or any other type of fantasy game. It is a pirate game, by the way, called Buckling Swashes. Of course there is the generic bad guy type that traps them in the game and tries to kill them. Like I said, it could have been any kind of game. Overall the pacing and the characters were really good. A really big criticism, and one that kept me from giving this a great review, is that while they are trapped in the game, they spend days being pirates. When Amy gets back to reality, it turns out that it was only a few hours. That is annoying.I will continue to read Katie Macalister's books mainly because she is a very funny writer and I like the fluff stuff a lot. This book doesn't make me as mad as Fire Me Up did.

It's ok to use a coincidence as a tool of suspense, but this was just overkill. Every chapter was boring. I got tired pretty quickly of pip wishing he were with Estella for the whole book. Also, the book seemed to stray away from the main point for chapters at a time. Who cares about Wemmick's stupid plays? This could all be summed up in a couple of page short story.

If you want to read a good Dickens story, read ""A Christmas Carol"" and nothing else written by Charles Dickens."

I was not really big on reading at the time, but he lent me this book. When I started reading, I found that I could not stop. This book is the story of Richard Cypher, a young woodsman who gets caught up in a struggle that could make the world slaves to an evil man named Darken Rahl. Richard becomes the next Seeker, wielding the Sword of Truth and from then on he vows to stop Darken Rahl. To aid him in this quest is a gorgeous woman named Kahlan, his guide through lands Richard could never even fathom. Beware of her though, she is a beautiful woman with a dangerous side to her. The two of them go through some very heart wrenching experiences and find themselves forbiddingly in love.Everything that falls into place in this book works very well with the ironies introduced. You will find yourself routing for the good guys and truly wanting to destroy the villains. For me personally, I was taken on the journey along with Richard. I fell in love with the very diverse character and the world that Mr. Goodkind creates.If you really want to get into a good fantasy series, then pick up Wizard's First Rule. Just give it a try, it is a really excellent book."

True, but I ask you, who among us is completely likeable? Who out there doesn't have some flaw? It is these flaws in Amory that make him one of the most wonderful characters in American Literary history.It's also true that This Side of Paradise is a young person's book because it deals with a coming of age and within Amory's character is a certain amoount of angst and maybe even repressed sexual anger, but still no matter who you are, wouldn't you rather read about a character you can relate to on more than just an idealized level like many of the characters in the Great Gatsby? Due to the strength of its central character, Amory Blaine, I think that This Side of Paradise is F. Scott Fitzgerald's real masterpiece."

I think he was trying to be Kawabata here (with the exception of the sex scenes, which, incongrously, made me think of Bukowski). And I'm all for that, in theory: writers ought to stretch their wings. But the reality is not pretty. Make no mistake: Kawabata would not have won the Nobel Prize if he wrote things like this.The problem is the protagonist and narrator, who is a deeply unlikable person. Obviously, that in itself isn't a literary judgment; nobody would condemn Lolita because Humbertx2 is on the despicable side (actually, somebody probably would. I don't want to know about it). But the fact is, Hajime is supposed to be sympathetic. Don't argue with me! He bloody IS! Every positive reviewer on this website thinks so. Not that I wouldn't be willing to concede that ninety-odd people could all be wrong, but they're not. He is. Murakami is working in overtime to try to create a sense of melancholy/regret/bittersweetness--all centered on his character. Unfortunately, he appears to be teetering on the edge of narcissistic personality disorder. All he does his entire life is hurt people. Sure, he feels guilty now and then, but guilt without action is meaningless: it's just a way to make yourself feel better without ever actually having to change in any way. Murakami's characters always have a certain degree of self-absorption, but ol' Hajime just takes the cake. It was utterly impossible for me to sympathize with him in any way. And the way his wife is willing to enable his pathology is simply stomache-turning, and creates the VERY strong impression that this is really nothing more than an unpleasant masturbatory fantasy.If you want subtle, lingering emotions of regret, read Kawabata. If you want Murakami, read Wind-Up Sheep Dance Wonderland. I can think of no good reason for you to read this misbegotten novel."

Kane,1,5,1106870400,Impressive and insightful,"This is a great book: enjoyable, entertaining, and enlightening. Craig's basic premise is that the way of kendo is something different to each and every student who picks up a Japanese sword. While traditional Kenjitsu had no rules per se, modern (sport) kendo does. He has fascinating insight into the differences and similarities between the two, asserting that to learn kendo properly practitioners must not think of it (or practice it) as a sport. If you don't already know, kendo uses bamboo shinai and padded armor for practice while kenjitsu uses live steel. To get the most out of these arts, Craig believes that you must think of them as a way of life, a perspective promulgated by most of the leading sword arts practitioners such as Dave Lowry as well.Craig's writings will advance your sword skills imparting knowledge of equipment, exercises, applications, and kata (including the last three kata of the All Japan Kendo Federation, which use the wakizashi short sword). More specifically, topics include kendo clothing, equipment and care thereof, fundamental movements, advanced waza, and kodachi katas. There is also great information about samurai sword collecting, care, maintenance, and terminology. The illustrations enhance the text and facilitate the reader's ability to understand and internalize Craig's excellent points. I think that the target audience is experience practitioners so it might be a bit beyond some beginners though. Regardless, this is a great book, a worthy addition to any martial arts library.Darrell Craig really knows his stuff. He holds a exceptionally impressive list of black belt ranks in several different martial arts, including kendo (renshi), karate (kyoshi), jujitsu (kyoshi); iaido (godan), kobudo (godan), judo (yodan), and aikido (yodan). He has worked as a martial arts choreographer on a number of feature films and is the author of several other martial arts books as well.Lawrence KaneAuthor of Surviving Armed Assaults, The Way of Kata, and Martial Arts Instruction"

This is done by looking in depth to find some facts that can explain them, so it is not a simple enumeration of raw data. This the author does very well, and the conclusion is clear: things are improving, and can improve faster if we put the resources to the real problems and avoid ghost problems that take nowhere. This is all so credibly explained and so rational that it seems very difficult to rebate. However, if this is so, why don't most scientists support this view? This is perhaps the most astonishing question that one gets in the end. People like me get caught between the opinions of those who say that the world is rapidly deteriorating and those who say that it is improving. Both have arguments. It is so difficult to decide between both, but the book shows many cases where respected scientists have exposed false data to support their view of the problem. This damages their credibility, and may explain the success of the book: we expect more seriousness from science. Sometimes I wonder if a really complex problem like this has so many interpretations that the position taken from most people is closer to religion than science, even scientists themselves."

Overall, it did. However, Gabbard needed a better editor/proofreader. There are numerous instances of misinformation in the captions on photos that are corrected in the text and vice versa. The photos, as a whole are quite good but have some obvious gaps. For instance, in 1969 he detail's Mario Andretti's ground-breaking 4-wheel drive Lotus 64, yet neglects to show any photos. Then there are out right errors such as when describing Peter Revson's first McLaren finish in 1970 as coming in 2nd, when in fact it was 22nd. For those looking for a broad overview of Indy's most progressive decade, this is an adequate review.

1587151294,Missing Man,5.5,A7BMU8ZJJ77I0,Mithridates VI of Pontus,1,5,1318032000,A Wonderful Sci-fi novel which deserves a wider audience,"Nominated for the 1975 Nebula Award for Best NovelKatherine MacLean's underrated and seldom read novel Missing Man (1975) was expanded from her 1971 Nebula Award winning novella by the same name. I've not read the original version so I'm unsure about how much was added, subtracted, or completely re-conceptualized.The novel version is a finely wrought vision of a future post-disaster Balkanized New York City comprised of innumerable communes, often at war with each other, inhabited by a small number of slightly telepathic people who are able to detect the emotions of others. Archetype individuals, without knowing, project emotions when they are in danger which could at any moment plunge society into intercommune war.Maclean's world buildings skills are second to none. She refrains completely from frustrating ""info dump lecture moments"" which plague si-fi and instead reveals the world slowly through the actions and observations of her characters. The result is an vibrant and organic world -- replete with dystopic threads -- which exudes realism.Katherine MacLean's prose is admirable. Beautiful sentences populate the pages, ""We tasted ethnic food and played strange archaic games and rituals of the reconstructed past"" (152). It takes a while to get used to the majority of the prose since it's a first person narrative from the point of view of a character, George Sanford, who's convinced he's unintelligent. As with Philip K. Dick's ""chicken headed"" characters in Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? (1968) George, despite his lack of schooling and inability to acquire a regular job due to his frequent mental breakdowns (and lack of focus), has moments of poignant wisdom and almost savant telepathic skill. MacLean's character building skills are on show -- George is a peculiar individual endowed with extraordinary mental gifts, an inability to settle down in any particular role in society, often manipulated by dubious or downright destructive people, yet possessed with an intense loyalty to his friends.Brief Plot Summary (some spoilers)George Sanford aimlessly wanders the streets during the day doing odd jobs, repeatedly trying to use his credit card on soup machines, and spends most nights at the Karmic Brotherhood commune -- one of many communes that make up New York City. Eventually he meets up with his childhood friend Ahmed employed by the Rescue Squad which tracks down emoting archetype individuals in danger whose negative emotions drive others to desperate acts. When George and Ahmed were children they both were members of an multiracial UN Brotherhood Gang which sought to protect people and sneak into various culture enclave communes.Ahmed enlists George Sanford's help in tracking down a missing girl. George's ""talent"" seems to be an odd capacity for guessing right and soon the girl is found. He's employed as a specialist by the Rescue Squad but lacks all ability and discipline to fill out forms, pass examinations, or adhere to guidelines. However Ahmed's trust in him is repeatedly vindicated when multiple emoting individuals are easily rescued.Soon a more nefarious scheme is uncovered after the inflatable dome of an underwater commune of city bureaucrats and their families collapses killing thousands. George discovers that a fifteen-year-old boy poet and historian named Larry is responsible. This boy has access to the workings of the city and plays the various self-serving communes off of each other. In this environment of terror George is increasingly persuaded by the veracity of boy's message that there's a government plot by the educated ""techs"" to persecute and sterilize everyone else...Final ThoughtsMacLean's vision of a decentralized and crumbling future New York replete with an Aztec Commune, Karmic Brotherhood Commune, Arab immigrant enclaves, underwater communes, emoting archetype individuals which threaten to engulf the city in violence and terror, endless carnivals, and roving gangs of children is beautifully realized. Throughout she pairs events with bits of news clips and soundbites. The telepathic abilities possessed by some are a matter of fact -- normality -- and never expounded on in pseudo-technical terms for pages and pages. George's character is most powerfully drawn from simple actions and situations -- for example his mental breakdowns which occur when he has to fill out paperwork for his position with the Rescue Squad. The characters, the world, and even the plot (the weakest element of the work) combine seamlessly.Missing Man deserves to be read, discussed, and rediscovered. One of the best sci-fi novels on telepathy you'll ever read.Pick up a copy."

He states in millions of disclaimers put into the book that he's never been in Utah and knows nothing about the thesis he's written for the book, but it's obvious he's educated on what he's talking about and stretches every topic into a fabricated lie and manages to be extremely insulting. I personally am not a Mormon, which the book mocks, but I am from Utah and this ""Heinous Truth About Utah"" doesn't exist. The only truth about Utah that you need to know is that there aren't many Religious Fanatics, despite what uneducated people say. It's a nice place to live with scenery that's to die for.

This topic is addressed with the help of the propagator for the quantum harmonic oscillator. The authors do not derive the propagator in this book, but suggest that it might be found in a quantum mechanics textbook. I should note that this propagator was not found in the QM textbooks that I own, but I was able to find its derivation online in the notes for the first semester of QM course given at University of Illinois (Physics 480--a course designation that has not changed in 40 years!) taught by Klaus Schulten. This derivation is found on pp.81-83 in chapter 4 of his notes.Also of interest to me is chapter 16, which deals with squeezing via non-linear optical processes, and chapter 18 which discusses the EPR process, hidden variables, and Bell's theorem."

Even as Christians they were willing to rationalize the usage of their bodies by men who were using and abusing them. There is prostitution, sexual abuse, and sex out of wedlock running rampant in their neighborhood and it's just a way of life for them. The main character never tells on her abuser because of fear. She feels sorry for HIM and cares for him in a strange way. It just goes to show how victims can be brainwashed into a sick attachment to their abusers. There is a sort of raw, sad, reality to this book that is rare. There is no wild, exciting plot line, just a long story of these women's lives and the realities they faced from when they were children through their adulthood."

His goal was to produce as accurate and faithful translation as the two languages would allow. That job was handled particularly well. There are extensive notes on the translation process and word choice. If you are looking for a very faithful tranlation, this book is for you.However, it's not for me. I am an avid military history reader and I was looking forward to this book. But, the dense run on sentences that characterize the Italian original makes for tough going.Lynch begins the book with an extensive introduction that sets the work in context both in Italian politics and in Machiavelli's life. I thought that was quite good.He (Lynch) ends the volume with an interpretive essay that I thought was a bit choppy and is more focused on Machiavelli (no surprise, that's his field). I was hoping for more on the art of war part. This is a facinating book in that it was written by a civilian with very little practical experience in the field. More of a compare/contrast look at how his ideas stacked up against the more conventional masters would have been nice."

A similar book, clearly labeled as fiction and written for the express purpose of entertainment, is The Da Vinci Code.

I LOVE the Midnight Louie series, and almost any book with animals as a main character. But the author spends so much time describing inane things in minute detail that the plot quickly gets lost. The plot itself has promise, and the characters are interesting, but the verbosity plaguing the pages of this diatribe make it a long and boring read. Not to mention the ending (last chapter) was stupid. Even if we are to believe this person turned herself from a cat to a human, are we also to believe she was able to marry, drive and get a job without a birth certificate, social security number or any other identification? I wish the editor had pulled out his/her red pen and cut this book in half - just get rid of all of the superfluous descriptions, and it may have a chance. If you're looking for an entertaining read, please skip this one and try the Midnight Louie series (Carole Nelson Douglas). You'll be better off for it."

Biographies of notable people in history can be one dimensional; but a two dimensional approach is necessary when writing about a scientist. The author must not only convey the personal elements, but also explain his significant discoveries in greater detail. The critical balance is whether or not to emphasize the the personal elements and go soft on the science; or to emphasize the science in greater depth, yet somehow reveal the person behind the scientific mind. The second choice, to include more of the exactness of the scientific discoveries is the choice of author Basil Mahon.Mahon reveals James Clerk Maxwell through his science, rather then showing, by human anecdotes, a personality that eclipses the scientific accomplishments. Maxwell lived in the age when science was more fluid and generalized, not so specialized as it is today. That is why Maxwell, a mathematician, made discoveries in the nature of Light, Electricity and Magnetism, and also worked in astronomy.In fact, in the 1800's, the title ""scientist"" did not exist. The study of natural phenomena was placed in the ancient classification of ""natural philosophy"". Fledgling scientists in the mid 1800's typically were wealthy individuals who pursued science as a hobby. The Law and Clergy were fields drawing bright young men.Mahon tells of of Maxwell's formative years, and covers the years at Edinburgh University, and Cambridge in depth, and throughout these years, Maxwell is performing experiments of his own. His character was generous towards others. He was quiet amongst total strangers, and vocal and stimulating amongst groups of his friends. He got up at 2 AM each night, and jogged through his lodgings until 2:30 AM. Maxwell was in these years, and for the many thereafter, a prolific letter writer, confiding in many acquaintances and advising them on their personal and public matters."

In order to follow Buchanan, we do need to grasp some basic concepts of network analysis. Fortunately, Buchanan presents this material in a manner that does not really require that we perform actual math, or even understand it at any basic level, but simply that we, too, like complexity theorists, learn to see some patterns that reoccur through many level of human and natural activities. Buchanan makes this process relatively easy as he leads us through the history of its development, beginning with the relatively recent interest in ""Small World"" problems such as the popular ""Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon"".Not only is the theoretical side of this work interesting, as it broadens our view of many phenomena, but to those who build or maintain systems such as web sites, it is immediately useful. Just as egalitarian or aristocratic systems have certain advantages, so do they have certain disadvantages. An aristocratic site will probably attract continually larger groups of visitors, but it is also very much easier to bring down than an egalitarian sites.

I have been able to ascertain by my reading two equally valid, yet mutually exclusive conclusions about this work. 1) It is the best book by this particular author 2) It is the worst book by this particular author.Now, normally I would try to defend both positions here, but I'll let that slide. The evaluation of a text is so subjective anyway; I will leave it up to you to decide. Not much happens in the story, but then a lot of little things happen as Egolf tells his tale again of an interesting low man brought lower yet redeemed (Think _A Confederacy of Dunces_).However, there were a couple of things that I found interesting. He leaves a little nugget in a reference to the plot of his earlier novel, _The Lord of the Barnyard_. I like this post-modern slip of self-referentiality when it is not overdone when the tales are otherwise unrelated. Also, interestingly, he calls out his future text _Kornwolf_, which is something that would get fuller treatment as a thematic element if this were an academic paper I didn't want to write.Stylistically, this book is one I called a gonzo collaboration of Hunter Thompson and David Foster Wallace. From my point of view that is a beautiful and dammed praise, as DFW's work is alienating and unpleasing to me. However, this alienation is avoided by Egolf; he is more humane and approachable. I wish he were still working and bringing beauty to this world."

It tackles the opposition of moments, not through anger or frustration but through the comedy of life. Alvarez hints to the excess of love in this world being focused on material possessions because of the before mentioned generational gap and the cynical views held by the previous generation. She expresses her belief in the allegiance to duty as being honorable. This book is a celebration of the &quot;single minded labors/of the single women artist.&quot; And finally this collection of poems calls into question the hierarchy of values and the idea that as human beings, men or women, &quot;What comes first?&quot; Overall, these poems are a direct link to the struggles and happiness women face in society today that are not just brought on by the patriarchal, but the mothers and grandmothers that preceded them."

In fact, I cannot remember a day in all of my history that I have read a non-fiction book without breaks for fiction, let alone in one day. I could not put Under the Overpass by Mike Yankoski down. I read the book in every spare minute from Tae Kwon Do Practice through Ballet and read again at night until the book was done.If you are not ready to make some changes in your life, don't read this book! Yankoski details his time undercover as a homeless person. Basically, he and a friend spent six months of their life traveling from one major city to another living as homeless people on the streets. They could not travel until they had the funds. They didn't take any funds with them except money for a one-way cab to the hospital in case of emergency. They didn't touch it. They didn't take but a minimum of clothing. They panhandled for money, ate in soup kitchens and rescue missions, showered only every three to six weeks, slept with rats and lived the experience as if it were real. As if they could not just pack up and head home whenever the going got rough or the six months was over. They tried to find refuge in churches, and were shocked at the number of times they were turned away and were not even allowed to stay and worship -- let alone offered food or clothing. They tried to encourage and witness to the homeless they lived near and fellowshipped with and discovered that most are addicted to drugs, alcohol or both and many have mental illnesses. Lives were changed. Mostly their own.This book comes with my HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION. I don't think I have ever said that before. Ever. I cannot wait to have my children read it. I have already changed how I live. See, for several weeks or months or years now I have been struggling with how I can clothe the naked and feed the hungry in the middle of my suburban, middle class, stay-at-home- Mom-with-six-kids life. And, I always think I will start remembering to at least buy a bag of groceries at the grocery store to put in the town food pantry box. But, I always forget. For months! And I walk out the door with a shrug and a vow to do better next time. Except this week, I decided that wasn't good enough. Without time to go back through the store, I decided to take the hit where it hurts -- from my own week's groceries. I'm sure I did not give enough, but I am not going to have enough sugar, flour, or chicken broth to make it through the weeks meals without another trip in the cold to the grocery. At least I do not have to walk! And, I am hoping that by sacrificing what I need from my own stash each week I will eventually remember to actually purposely buy useful food for our hungry in my hometown. I am actively looking for other opportunities to help the poor in our community. I wasn't doing that before.Please buy this book and read it. And buy it as Christmas gifts. It's compelling. It's fascinating. You won't want to put it down. You walk away a better person for it."

I came to it with some reservations as a Leroux fan, but those reservations were blown away after the first page and I was literally sucked in to this amazing story by the sheer power of the writing. What a magnificent writer Ms Kay is and how beautifully she carries off her daring project to give us the life story of such a famous fictional character. She must have known it had to be darned good or she would have been shot down in flames by such a huge fan base and yet she pulls it off. With it's lyrical prose, first class characterization and fast moving plot, it justly deserves all the praise that has been heaped on it over the years.And as Leroux fan I have to say I raised my eyes in some horror when I read a couple of the recent reviews below. Mauling a well respected book like Kay's, in Leroux's name, simply makes us Leroux fans look as though we have an axe to grind. I was actually uncomfortable and embarrased to mention the fact that I was a Leroux fan in such company. Of course we want people to read and love Leroux's wonderful original, but this is not the way to achieve it."
1420843818,No Such Thing As A Secret: A Brandy Alexander Mystery,16.95,AKR4DH6WLF6GG,Linda Bulger,0.9166666666666666,5,1217116800,Brandy takes stock of her life,"I've got great news: there's a new amateur sleuth on the block and she's funny, literate, impulsive and wry. This native Philly girl stampeding into your life is named Brandy Alexander but blame her odd parents for that, not the girl herself. Author Shelly Fredman scored a hit with this new series.Brandy has a big-city job in L.A. presenting human interest stories on a local TV show. That kept her away from Philadelphia for four years; that and the urge to be far away from the sexy cop ex-boyfriend who dumped her. Now she's back for her best friend's wedding, but life conspires to throw Brandy into a dangerous stew of corrupt politics, threats, murder, and romance.The mystery plot is creative and full of false trails, but the real stars here are the impetuous Brandy and her beautifully-drawn South Philly family and friends. Swear to God, you'll think you're there with the gang. Johnny Marchiano, up to his ears in danger for reasons yet to be discovered. Franny Di Angelo, the bride-to-be, and her twin sister Janine. Brother Paulie, Uncle Frankie and his girlfriend Carla ... I've never been to South Philly but I'd know this crowd anywhere; each and every one has Brandy's back, no matter how they roll their eyes at her sarcasm.In no time Brandy puts herself in harm's way with her amateur investigating. There's plenty of hatchet-and-gun danger but her heart's at risk too. There's the ex-boyfriend, still hot but with a wife and child (currently MIA). Oh, and the heart-stoppingly sexy Nick Santiago, riding shotgun on her forays to the underbelly of the city. Sleep-deprived and on a permanent sugar rush from her chocolate habit, Brandy somehow manages to keep her head and get to the bottom of the trouble. (You all understand the genre, so I trust that won't be a spoiler.)This book works in so many ways: terrific first-person narrative from a crazy-girl-next-door heroine, a stellar supporting cast, the back-story threaded through nicely rather than served up in a dry lump, teasers for the next book in the series. My favorite thing aboutNO SUCH THING AS A SECRET: A Brandy Alexander Mysteryis the underlying subtlety and intelligence that kicks it up a notch from beach reading to something just a bit more.And the best news of all is that there are already two more Brandy Alexander books in print, which are on their way to my mailbox right now. Author Shelly Fredman had better be planning a long writing career because her fans are going to demand it of her.Linda Bulger, 2008"

Newman ""Bob Newman""",0.9166666666666666,5,1046131200,"&#65533;Nerdy Wordsmith Rats On Flame, Conks Out Young&#65533;","Fidel Castro and his bearded men charged down out of the Sierra Maestra and paraded victorious through the streets of Havana to delirious cheers of adoring crowds. Mao Tsetung arrived with his vast armies at Beijing and declared that ""China had stood up"". The `Internationale' played and a brave new world began. We dreamed we would change the world as youths, we might die for a great cause, we yelled at barricades (of whatever material-or perhaps they were intangible) and loved with the passions of the times. Repression of anybody (except ""the exploiters"") never appeared on the cards, no, it was freedom in the air. Hasn't this atmosphere repeated itself time and time again, across the globe ? And there's always a poet or two to inscribe glorious verses on the stones of History. Byron, Mayakovsky, Rimbaud, Marti, Rizal. But what if `the Revolution' ushers in a period of less freedom, greater oppression, and wider stupidity that leads to mass fatalities ? Then what kind of poet would you need ? Well, what kind do you get ? Artists who paint girl + tractor. Novelists who write books called ""Cement"". And poets like Jaromil, the subject of this great novel. Fidel called the people who fled the new Cuba ""gusanos"" or worms. Reading Kundera's novel about Czechoslovakia, you feel strongly that the gusanos remained and cooperated, wrote poetry in praise of the unpraise-able. Or, maybe there's a global glut of gusanos. Maybe a gusano poet is about as necessary as wings on a turtle.OK, this novel is a fictional biography of a very weedy mama's boy who remains nave, protected and innocent despite everything that happens around him, even the death of his father in a concentration camp. The world around the main characters, the society at large, remain pale and nearly invisible. He (and we) really see nobody except his mother---his loves are extensions of his ego, his poetry or paintings the same. Dreams and fantasy are his stock in trade, his alter-ego jumps in and out of beds, while Jaromil stews. All is self-absorption. In modern America, the poet would be called a ""dweeb"". We have to laugh at Jaromil or scorn him. LIFE IS ELSEWHERE is a satire that concentrates on unpleasant aspects of the human condition so well that you cringe time and time again. Kundera spares no one, not his main character and certainly not his readers. Jaromil is surrounded, as the author says, with a wall of mirrors, and cannot see beyond. We look into our own mirrors as we read. It's doubtful that we admire the reflections. The basic themes are human nature, art and literature in society, and the sad tribulations of a small nation. Kundera, like Brazil's Machado de Assis, cuts his books up into extremely small chapters, which is an effective tool in expert hands. Each one makes a point, introduces an irony, or engages in new soul-searching. The plot of LIFE IS ELSEWHERE is minor; it is the process of writing and thinking about the issues that counts. Ah, well, readers, I'm not giving anything away to say that the message here is that people who fail to live life to the fullest always pine for some far away paradise where great deeds would be accomplished effortlessly, and imagine that ""life is elsewhere"". These deluded ones are capable of the dirtiest deeds. Oh, yeah, this is a good book."

0743200314,Shakespeare's Kings: The Great Plays and the History of England in the Middle Ages: 1337-1485,25.76,A28WM1RZHBKLH,James R. Mccall,1,4,1016150400,"An Absorbing History, but Not to be Confused With the Plays","This book tells the story - long, confusing, but connected - of the English kings of the late Middle Ages, from the downfall and death of Edward II in 1327 and the accession of his son Edward III. His successor Richard II was deposed and killed by the Lancastrian Henry IV. Then followed his son Henry V and a great time for England against France in their ongoing Hundred-Years War. His son Henry VI was so ineffectual he set off the long bizarre dynastic scuffle called the Wars of the Roses, from which the Yorkist Edward IV finally emerged. He had his own middle brother, George, killed, but his youngest brother, the infamous Richard of Gloucester, slaughtered his way to the throne, holding it for a tenuous two years as Richard III, until the resurgent Lancastrians finally got rid of him and the whole bloody Middle Ages, and put Henry VII (the first Tudor) on the throne in 1485 - the first decent ruler poor England had seen in a century and a half.This was the period that Shakespeare chose for his history plays. To the Elizabethans these events were still reasonably current (as our Civil War is to us), and yet enough removed - and of a different dynasty - to be safe in the playing. (Not quite: Elizabeth's (former) favorite Essex paid for a special performance of Richard II, which concerns the deposing of a legitimate monarch, and soon after he was proclaimed a traitor.) The politically savvy playwright wanted to walk the fine line between telling the ripping good yarn of these brutal yet colorful fellows, while somehow not tarnishing the gloss of the monarchy itself.But Shakespeare was no historian. He has modified the story to suit political and dramatic exigencies, and often, it appears, by mistake. The dynastic interweavings are confusing, and his sources had gaps and contradictions, so sometimes he misplaces characters and events. More often, though, he has to tell a long story in a short time, and give it some push. Thus the compression and conflation of events, the exaggeration of character.Ok, so maybe watching the plays is not the best way to learn English history. Certainly, Norwich brings this home. He gently but relentlessly documents Will's departures from the actual history, and they are legion. Every once in a while, in this book, he devotes a chapter to the particular play that ""covers"" the material he has discussed to that point. Basically, each of these chapters goes through the play at hand - I Henry IV, say - and shows how it deviates from or hews to the truth. After a few of these chapters, I just skipped them: the tale Norwich tells in his history sections is great fun, but the Shakespeare chapters simply drive home the point that the plays are at best approximations to the actual. Fair enough: I'm convinced. I still want to watch the plays: they contain cultural and emotional truth after all, besides being, many of them, great plays.So, read this book for the history, rather than the Shakespeare criticism. And though the plays are not good history, reading a good popular history is not irrelevant to enjoying them: after all, they were written for a public that already had a better than nodding acquaintance with the events they portray. And so should you."

Gallup,1,3,1326672000,the first glimmer of hope,"I read this book while on the waiting list to take my developmentally disabled baby to Glenn Doman's Institutes for the Achievement of Human Potential. My wife and I had previously been advised to read hisHow to Teach Your Baby to Read (The Gentle Revolution), which in turn prompted me to contact the Institutes, learn what they proposed to do with kids like mine, and then apply.With regard to reviews pointing out that this response is not endorsed by the mainstream: yup, it's not, and alternatives like this exist for the very reason that for many years the mainstream has had little to offer in response to the urgent demand for help from afflicted families. Our son's doctors recommended only patience for a year and then counseling to help us learn to accept the inevitable. They never attempted to help our son.On the other hand, those who discern a cult-like attitude on the part of people who go to the Institutes are justified in that observation. Parents who must have hope that their kids' futures can be better do tend to embrace whatever is said by those who offer that hope. It's understandable, although I regret the us-vs-them attitude with regard to the outside world.We were on the Institutes' Intensive Program for four years, from 1986 to 1990, during which time my immobile son became a walker and made other impressive gains, and I documented the experience in a memoir.For someone who has the driving motivation to find answers for a beloved child's poorly understood problems, Doman's book offers perhaps the first glimmer of hope. His account tells how he and the other founders of the Institutes arrived at their philosophy, and while some of what he says was out of date even when I read it, that philosophy struck me as being very common-sensical. Until other resources also offer hope, the appeal of this sort of thing is undeniable.My view of Doman's Institutes itself is more complicated than my view of his book, but the book about how it came into being deserves an enduring place in the literature."

0972307109,One Hour,9.99,A27WDJ0R06DMOB,"Samaya Young ""S.Y.""",1,4,1233100800,Plays with the Mind,"One Hour by Todd Sullivan.A collection of short stories, poems and a novella.I find it hard to give an opinion of a genre that I have never before read, so I'll go with the impressions I get while reading Sullivan's collection of stories and poems.To Descend:I find it to be a well-written short story that certainly manages to capture my attention by the time paragraph two starts. There is a rather eerie atmosphere in the tale. It shows a blatant view of the partying theme, and delivers a figurative slap in the face that gives a rather disturbing nightmarish feel once the plot comes to its conclusion. It's gritty, intense and to me, showing the reader a grim effect of living on a constant high.Blessed are the Children (an excerpt of ""Addicts"")This is another short story in a similar genre. Different, yes, but staying on the same theme with a slight twist to it. The controlled-user vs. the full-blown addict combined in such a way that it was certainly captures the very present and dangerous lure of mindless oblivion. While reading, I can feel the protagonist's inner struggle against his demanding habit; the urge he experiences for that next line, pill and whatnot while trying to create a future for himself. It shows excellent penmanship on Sullivan's part. The inner battle being fought-and lost-as old friends draw the controlled-user from the firm boundaries he has set out of necessity.The Door,Certainly is an interesting concept. Unlike the previous two this story seems to be about self-discovery, more than anything. The question of what we are here for, asked, while wrapped into a story that reads rather like a biography. What are you? A drone in the masses, or an individual?It has been done before but Sullivan does give it a nice bit of spice...albeit a pungent one.Basically this story shows two different characters; one submits, adjusts and gives up his dreams...or so it seems...while the other fights tooth and nail and does literally everything in an attempt to push at the boundaries of reality and mortality. A basic opposites attract, perhaps...or something more? It is left open to debate.The Magician,I think that this one is my favorite of the collection. The story seems to be about dreamers: The Observer and the Doer with just a hint of magic, which makes it a fascinating concept. Is this world we live in real, or not? Are my dreams really dreams, or are my waking hours in fact the illusions? It is a concept I've wondered about and in ""The Magician"" Sullivan does portray that very question in a poignant way. Will you take that ""leap of faith""? Are you prepared to bear the consequences?In one word: Fascinating.Redemption,A man fighting against a troubled past that haunts him, on the most part. A complex character giving up on life when he sees no other option in order to battle a habit that can, and will, kill without remorse or regret. The story appears to be mostly about the struggle between good and evil...or at least that is what sticks with me most by the time I finish reading it.One Hour,An interesting concept: The internal search for perfection and the price one has to pay to achieve it. The story speaks of the drive for being the best, and reaching that pinnacle of success, either personally or career-wise, no matter what the cost.I find it to be a little disturbing, but the imagery and dialogue are done in a descriptive and cohesive fashion.What follows is a collection of wandering thoughts-or stories if you will-poems and fragments that give an interesting insight into the author's mind, more than anything, I believe.I thought the short story titled ""Night"" was very eloquently put, imaginative too, making an event that seems ordinary, something to think about instead.Though poetry is not my usual cup-of-tea, the words are chosen well, creating an excellent flow for those who enjoy such writings.Of the collection of poems I think that the ""Equator"" spoke to me most, however. It created a certain imagery that I liked, and it will linger in my mind, I'm sure.The Great Escape Artist,This is the last story in this rather complex, and sometimes even dark, book. I thought this one to be captivating, however, so I must say that it is a marvelous ending of Sullivan's collection.It describes a bleak and rather depressing world of a ""different"" youth, struggling to find the reason for his existence, when for all appearances there seems to be none. Misunderstood and a dreamer, he must wage his internal and outer battles and fight with all his might, since to this youth the world is a miserable and lonely place where he does not fit into in any shape or form.All that sustains him is his incredible power of imagination that can take him practically anywhere, and requires close attention of the reader, immersing into this tale.I think that many people experience battles (such as the youth experiences) during the course of their lives in this day and age, so this tale will certainly speak to those able to identify with the main character.There is infinite sadness in this story, and it shows me (the reader) what the youth has to face; it makes me FEEL his sadness, and his desolation when he can find no one who understands him and therefore often flees within the vast spaces of his mind.This character trait was certainly well described by the author, and made me travel with the youth on his inner journeys in a graphic fashion.Like I said, I found it captivating and even beautiful...be it in a sad way.Conclusion:One Hour is an interesting read with a variety of aspects that will ""speak"" to the eclectic reader most, I believe: Real life with a hint of the incredible at times, and a bit of magic thrown into the mix."

I received an advanced copy of Fiber Menace for review. Before reading this book, I thought I knew a lot about nutrition. I thought I had a great grasp on fiber's role in our diet and on the importance of consuming plenty of it...Fiber Menace convinced me that the ""truths"" I had absorbed from other books, articles, and the food industry were in fact highly questionable. Fiber, it turns out, can actually be very harmful in the quantities recommended by the ""establishment."" Our bodies become addicted to it -- and then depend on it to stay regular. Basically, we get into a vicious cycle. Fiber Menace explains how that happens, what the results are (frightening and not always apparent until later in life) and what to do about it now. Since reading the book, I've changed my diet. For example, I've cut way back on fiber, I don't rely on drinking water to force down the food (as I've discovered this is not how our bodies function), I've stopped forcing myself to drink those 8 glasses of water daily, etc...the result is that I'm already starting to feel better after a relatively short period of time.Author Konstantin Monastyrsky boldly challenges many truths about diet and nutrition, taking to task Dr. Atkins and many other diet gurus whose teachings many of us had taken as gospel (often with mixed to poor results!).

Robbins is so eloquently captured on these pages, both in images, and in his own words, that I came away from the book feeling as if I had known him. And, feeling nothing but admiration for his courage, and his determination to excel. He truly was THAT BROADWAY MAN. It was so refreshing to read a biography about a famous person that focused on his work, and his success, instead of just dishing the dirt. I was not particularly interested in his failures; we all have them. I was interested in how he pushed through them and kept going...to give us a body of work so entertaining, and innovative, it literally takes your breath away. The book is absolutely fascinating.

Chase ""Al Chase""",0.6666666666666666,5,1153267200,"Mini-Review: ""Militant Islam in Southeast Asia - Crucible of Terror"" by Zachary Abuza","I acquired this book, ""Militant Islam in Southeast Asia,"" in order to do some background research for a novel I am writing. My book is a long-term project with no projected publication date as yet. It is a rather ambitious undertaking - a retelling of ""The Odyssey"" set as an Al Qaeda terrorist story that takes place partly in Indonesia! So, in preparation for an eventual fact finding trip to Indonesia, I have been doing some reading about terrorism and Southeast Asia.Zachary Abuza is on the faculty in the Political Science and International Relations Department at Simmons College in Boston. He has traveled extensively in researching this book, which has received enthusiastic praise from many quarters.W. Scott Thompson of Tuft's University's legendary Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy had this to say about Abuza's work:""Showing an astonishing persistence in tying together the threads of the terrorist threat, Abuza has come up with a dazzling display of Al-Qaida at work. It is rare that a book comes out with so deep and thoughtful analysis of a contemporary subject - this may well become the standard reference on everything happening in the Southeast Asian theater of the world terror crisis.""Barnett, in ""The Pentagon's New Map,"" and in his recent ""Blueprint for Action,"" makes it clear that Southeast Asia, especially Indonesia, will play a pivotal role over the next several decades in impacting the balance of power among the leaders of what Barnett calls ""the Core"" and the ""New Core."" Indonesia is the largest Muslim nation in the world, and will play a significant part in determining the relationship between the United States and the Muslim world. Therefore, Abuza's seminal work becomes a very helpful tool in understanding how terrorism in general - and Al-Qaeda in particular - may serve as a crucial factor in determining how the relationship between the West and the worldwide Muslim may evolve.Using painstakingly well-documented and footnoted research, Abuza traces the growing influence of Al-Qaeda in Southeast Asia - from Afghanistan and the jihad against the Soviets to the bombing in Bali and beyond. His basic premise follows a logical chain of events. Following the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, many zealous Southeast Asians who had fought as mujahadin returned to Asia to use their skills and battlefield experiences to bring the passion of jihad to several local struggles to establish autonomous Muslim states through Southeast Asia. These struggles included the secessionist movements in Mindanao, East Timor, Sulawesi and the Malukus and Aceh - among others. Once the U.S. attacked Afghanistan to topple the Taliban and neutralize the command and control of Bin-Laden's team, Al-Qaeda was forced to flee from its lair in Afghanistan and scatter among a handful of safe havens - many in Southeast Asia. At first, these safe havens - Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand - were used as a convenient ""back offices"" for Al-Qaeda to conduct training, money-laundering, weapons acquisition and coalition building. Al-Qaeda also funded and co-opted many local insurgents and gave them a vision of taking part in a global jihad against the ""savage intervention of the American Crusade Armed Forces and their allies [who are involved] in the Muslim cleansing scheme. . . as a `harsh reprimand' to Jews and Christians led by American heathens in oppressing and tainting the Islamic holy land, where the Revelation of the Prophets descended."" (Pages 166-167).Eventually, the terrorists took advantage of lax security and political dissent in these nations to launch terrorist attacks on soft targets within these host nations - the bombing in Bali being the most spectacular and deadly among these incidents.For anyone who wants to develop a more comprehensive understanding of where Al-Qaeda is heading in its long-term strategy and short-term tactics, this book as a valuable resource.Al"

Ok kid see how well that attitude works for you in college.The one word description of #56 Courtney Love is just classicThe crowning achievement of this list for me is Peter Singer(30 something) who has made a lot of friends among my fellow disabled people by saying that disabled children should be either aborted or killed at birth for the betterment of the species. This would be bad enough however Mr. Singer says that you can kill a baby up to a month old that shows signs of weakness or frailty he equates this to returning a car that turned out to be a lemon.On behalf of disabled people everywhere Mr. Singer thanks very much its always good to feel loved and cared for which I always thought was the true mark of an enlightened society.Now I have issues with the book four of them actually Rodney King, Jesse Jackson and Michel Moore way too predictable.

Even if you are not intending to become a total vegetarian it will provide you with a newer healthy perspective of what to eat and how to find the various products.One aspect of the book that I find interesting is the wide amount of research done about socio-economic impacts of a general meat-eating populus. It actually points out that a lot of essential foods (vegetables etc) are used in producing cattle/meats, where this could quite sensibly be used for human consumption instead (why feed animals when you can feed humans ?). The ratio of vegetable protein used to produce meat is 16:1. That means that you are wasting 15 of the 16 pounds of grain to provide the same amount of useful consumable meat protein. A simple but a very poignant observation.All in all, the book provides a lot of information and clarifies mis-information about a vegetarian (or vegan) lifestyle. I would strongly recommend you read it even if it's just for your education. You will absolutely learn something."

This retelling of the Chinese version of the Big Bad Wolf certainly is cause for the awarding of the Caldecott Medal for Best Children's Literature in 1990. In addition to his story, Ed Young's shape-shifting art merges tale with sight for a free-flowing, fluid interpretation of the wolf.The Chinese tale is different. Three little girls are left home while their mother goes to see the sick grandmother. At dark the wolf makes his appearance, blowing out the inside light as soon as possible. The illustrations are murky, like the light in the room, and only glints of teeth and whites of eyes can be discerned. But the oldest girl knows what's up and tricks the wolf into wanting gingko nuts high in the tree outside their house.No woodchoppers in the Chinese version--only one smart oldest daughter and two thoughtful, obedient younger daughters. How they defeat the wolf is sheer brilliance.Ed Young's illustrations deserve separate praise. Since most of the story takes place during the cover of night, he must show his scenes in darkness. However, he adds touches and big swaths of reds, purples, greens, blues, salmons, golds, to present the story. Beautiful, eye-popping, and very effective!"

Denny,0.2727272727272727,3,1072656000,"Good, but . . .","Like another reviewer or two, I found some flaws in this book. First, the author almost lost me with the dumb name for the owner of the bookstore - Page Turner. Please! When you start tossing cutesy, highly unlikely names in a story (like Candy Cane), it's hard to take the writing seriously. Secondly, many things defied belief. I find it hard to believe many employers would agree to pay their help in cash &quot;under the table&quot;. A scumbag like Page Turner (there's that dumb name again!) would, but Helen also found a manager of a major &quot;Wal-Mart-type&quot; discount store willing to do so. Why would an employee want to be paid cash? For the reasons our heroine, Helen, wanted to - so there is no paper trail and no record of her. Why would a person do that? The only reason I can think of is Helen's reason, she is on the lam. Why would an employer be willing to take on someone running from the law?Some of the characters are not well fleshed out - when she talked about &quot;Denny&quot; or &quot;Brad&quot; at the bookstore, I couldn't remember which was which. The older stuffed-shirt of a clerk/manager, Albert, was a more well-drawn character. The old guy, Mr. Davies, who came in to sit and read all day, was sweet.I did disagree, however with the criticism one reviewer had about why Helen was running. For most of the book, we only know she caught her husband with another woman and grabbed a crowbar. Did she kill him? His lover? I felt the author did a good job of keeping that titillating fact dangling just long enough.Despite some flaws, I found myself continuing to pick up the book and read it - and that is worth 3 stars. The flavor of the locale (Florida) is well done, and Helen and her landlady, Margery are characters you want to get to know."

The plot of this novel is nothing new. In fact in the romance genre it's probably been done a million times. Little girl in small town has crush on bad boy...girl grows up and leaves small town...rich, matchmaking relative dies and there's a will to be read - a will with a few interesting stipulations, that is...and well, you know what comes next, right? But Ms. Gibson manages to spice up the story with a very intriguing backstory. I was captured by the story of little Delaney and little Nick hiding their affection for each other as they grew up as the goody-goody adopted daughter and shunned illegitimate son of Truly, Idaho's leading citizen. Unfortunately, their adult relationship seems to resolve around little more than left-over physical attraction. If there are deeper feelings involved they are indeed very deeply hidden. Oh there are occasional instances where the main characters are actually nice to each other. But these instances are very few and far between. Communication and emotional sharing is very obviously absent from this novel. It's one thing for hero and heroine to say they love each other but, I'd like to see them show it every once in a while. A lot of sex and bickering just doesn't do it for me. But the author does get praise for her character development, dialogue and fast paced plot. With better romantic development this story could have been a keeper. Ms. Gibson does a better job of developing the romantic relationship of her main characters in her earlier novel, Simply Irresistible.

However, he seems to use wit and rhetorical skills as a replacement for substance and consistency. His hyperbolic extrapolation on statistics reaches a degree of absurdity early on and continues from there when he goes on about the iminent ""crisis"" in Japan due to a shortage of people. I have been to Japan many times and I challenge anyone to hop on a train in Tokyo at rush hour while the white-gloved pushers are packing everyone in and proclaim, ""There are simply too few people in this country."" He also fails to consider that the aging of the Japanese population has a lot to do with having the world's highest life expectancy, largely due to an effective universal health care system, the likes of which Steyn condemns. Steyn cannot grasp the idea that birth rates are not constant and cannot be projected indefinitely into the future.This brings us to the next egregious oversight in the book, which is Steyn's continual assertion that the Euro-style social democratic system is economically unfeasible, whereas America's system is just fine. What he fails to understand is that European workers pay lots of taxes, which in turn pays for all of those services. Our government, on the other hand, cuts taxes while spending more money than European countries could even dream of by engaging in poorly planned wars of choice largely funded by our last enemy (Russia), our current enemy (Saudi Arabia), and our future enemy (China), to all of which we owe tons of money and rising. Which of these systems sounds more sustainable to you?Where this book really goes over the line, however is in its unabashed hatemongering, best exemplified by quotes like this:""The salient feature about Islamism is that if you are a violent thug, embracing this particular religion doesn't mean having to do anything icky like help with the church bazaar or be nice to gay people. As in Islamist, you can pretty much carry on doing all the things you like doing, and the only difference is you'll be doing them for your new religion. You can lie, cheat, steal, rape, kill women and children, and as long as you're doing it for Allah and his victory over the infidels, it's cool.""To claim that this bastardization of a religion to justify horrible wrong-doing is a uniquely and inherently Islamic phenomenon is to ignore all of the history of Western colonialism which, across the globe and over the decades and centuries, resulted in the deaths of untold millions as people spread out from Europe on Christianizing missions of conquest. Mark Steyn dismisses the idea that Christianity has also been subject to such horrific interpretations by building one of his classic ""straw men"" in stating that the Spanish Inquisition was the only significant historical incident where Christianity went immoral.In the final chapter, he states three possible responses to this demographic problem: 1.) Submit to Islam. 2.) Destroy Islam. 3.) Reform Islam. He claims that the first is disastrous, the second would be too much trouble (no mention of any kind of moral qualms with that solution) and the third is not ours to do. The bulk of the text leads me to believe that Steyn comes dangerously close to advocating #2 in his ceaseless demonizing of an entire demographic group, rather than certain elements within it, and his assertions that #1 is reprehensible and #3 is up to the Muslims, while then ending his book on an ambiguous call for action.While his denunciations of overdependence on state institutions and cultural relativism with its accompanying complacency are valid and well stated, he completely ignores the idea that there might be some kind of rational case to be made for America not being seen as an undeniably benevolent force in the world. Although liberals spend too much time pointing the finger inward and not enough pointing outward, Steyn commits the opposite sin. He attributes the radicalization of young Muslims to the fiery rhetoric of the imams and other community leaders, while failing to see how American troops killing untold numbers of innocent civilians (Haditha, etc.), supporting Israel in doing the same (Tyre, etc.), and capturing and torturing Muslims both innocent and guilty (Abu Ghraib, Gauntanamo, CIA ""black sites"") may be far more persuasive to young Muslims than any Imam could possibly be. It may all be collateral damage in a necessary cause, but try explaining that to those on the receiving end. Steyn's biggest failure is in assuming America's total goodness based on the obvious total badness of radical Islam and failing to address the substance of arguments that question this assumption. If this book is as mainstream as I fear that it is, we are getting closer and closer to losing any claims to any kind of moral high ground in the world."

I have never had any issues with digesting coconut oil or any foods made with it. Not being able to process fats properly is a big concern since many important vitamins are fat-soluble. The coconut oil provides an easy way to provide my body with processable fat that will help me to absorb necessary vitamins.

Halliday has a wonderful gift, however, for pointing out the humor in all of these situations. She also describes unusual experiences which most travel books would never cover, and that is exactly what makes this book different from most travel books: you won't learn about all the museums and palaces in each country she has visited. Instead, you'll learn why you might *not* want to buy cigarettes from an 8-year-old on the streets of Vietnam, why there is no such thing as a free backrub, and why you should bolt your doors when staying in Pushkar, India.

1590171497,The Man Who Watched Trains Go By (New York Review Books Classics),11.02,A28PRU8FTMCT8J,"Leonard Fleisig ""Len""",1,4,1161129600,Nihilism is not only despair and negation,"but above all the desire to despair and to negate. Camus.Despair and negation predominate in Georges Simenon's ""The Man Who Watched Trains Go By"", a book that I considered to be darker than noir.Simenon was nothing if not prolific in both his literary and public life. Born in Belgium in 1903, Simenon turned out hundreds of novels. Simenon's obsession with writing caused him to break off an affair (he was prolific in this area of his life as well) with the celebrated Josephine Baker in Paris when he could only write twelve novels in the twelve month period in which they were involved. Although perhaps best known for his Inspector Maigret detective novels, Simenon also wrote over a hundred novels that he referred to as `romans durs' (literally ""hard novels""). As with many of his contemporaries such as Chandler and Hammett, Simenon's books were marketed and sold as popular, pulp fiction. Also like Chandler and Hammett, Simenon's books have stood up well over time. The New York Review of Books publishing division has reissued much of Simenon's books. They are well worth reading and ""The Man Who Watch Trains Go By"" is an excellent place to start.The story's protagonist and narrator is Kees Poppinga. As the book opens Kees is seen and sees himself as a stolidly middle-class Dutch citizen living a life of relative comfort in the coastal town of Groningen. He is secure in his job as the manager of a ship's supply company. His sense of security is reflected in an attitude best described as smug and more than a bit conceited. On the surface, Kees' life seems well insulated from the harsher side of life. But Simenon shows us quickly that this appearance of security was really a thin veneer that could be washed away at a moment's notice. One night, Kees discovers that his company's owner has driven the company into bankruptcy. Kees will soon be out of the job and will likely lose everything he holds dear.The rest of the book focuses on Kees' decent from smug satisfaction to nihilism and despair. Stripped of his middle-class sense of security Kees finds that he is also stripped of all those societal restraints that most civilized members of society have. Kees embarks on a journey of death, deceit, and madness. The only character trait that remains is one of conceit and superiority as he travel to Paris and falls in with the Parisian underworld.The reader experience this journey through the narration of Kees and Simenon does an excellent job of allowing the reader to look out at the world through the eyes of a madman. It is something of an uncomfortable feeling but it made for compelling reason. I have already compared Simenon to Chandler and Hammett because they wrote in a similar genre and were contemporaries. As far as contemporary writers are concerned, the French-writer Michel Houellebecq (Elementary Particles) seems remarkably similar in both tone and style.I have now read two of Simenon's romans durs and three of his Inspector Maigret mysteries. They have all been worth reading and if you are interested in either the detective genre or the type of dark psychological novel described here, Simenon is well worth discovering. L. Fleisig"

Map lovers take note: there are three wonderful maps included in the book.The collection of characters is quirky and interesting. ""Normal"" people need not apply. Yet it is those characters who bring this story to life and make it so wonderful to read. They are created slowly and with gentle irony by Ms. Vargas. This is definitely a character-driven story. That's not to say the plot isn't well done.The plot is clever and believable with some good suspense. I certainly learned more about the history of the plague on the continent.In spite of the translation gaffes--I understand they changed translators after book two--I really enjoyed this book.

1890626538,7 Myths of Working Mothers: Why Children and (Most) Careers Just Don't Mix,24.95,A1TI0PVCNUUWAS,"Cozy Cat ""At Home""",0.7058823529411765,5,1132272000,Telling the Hard Truths,"I'm going to post my review before I read any others -- and say that I can only imagine how hopping mad this book will make mothers who choose to work. The author has decided to cut through the culture's politically correct rhetoric and simply tell it like it is: children want their moms around. Her basic premise, while covering myriad other issues in the debate that rages on versus moms who stay at home and moms who choose to work, is this: motherhood has become all about the mother's needs and not the children's needs. This can only be a decidedly unpopular argument in a culture that celebrates putting the almighty Self ahead of everything else.Venker nails so many juicy truths, unflinchingly, that she's got my admiration. She clearly doesn't give a hoot about being ""popular"" because she's presenting clear hard facts about shunning one's children in the name of seeking chosen ""fulfillment"" outside the home while children are left to pay the price of feeling shuttled and ignored. The negative fall out is many-layered. But the best message the author presents is actually a question: Why do women who have no desire to do the work of motherhood (and she rightly calls it work, noting that it is sometimes tedious, thankless, sacrificial and requires vast amounts of time) even have children to begin with? These women are enamored of the IDEA of having kids, not the steadfast reality. Yes! This is true! FINALLY, someone has asked why this sort of uncommitted woman even HAS kids.I ""stayed home"" (that is, made the commitment to be a full time mother, and whole-heartedly, I might add) in the 1980's. My husband and I lived in a 2-bedroom condominium and scrimped mightily so that I could be home; we had a second child while in the same condo (because we couldn't afford to move) and, 9 years after the second child, we were joyfully surprised with a third. We didn't always relish living in a condo while other families with two incomes (or even just other families) moved ""onward and upward"", and I never appreciated the pervasive opinion from society at large that we could do ""better"" for our family by bringing in more money if I would only go to work. Ha! What I appreciated, and still do, and will forever, is that I was raising my own children.More important are the memories my kids have voiced now that they're teenagers. They recall the comfort and ease of being reared in an unhurried environment, with me there, and they always remember other kids coming over to our place who had nobody home at their own. I remember that, too. Looking back, I am grateful to have had other kids in our apartment while their moms were gone, to feed them home-cooked meals, hug them when they felt sad, assure them that their moms really did love them. And while I may have been a brief comfort in their lives, I wasn't their mom.So that's the reality for mothers who choose to work: your kids will miss you. Dearly. You will feel a nebulous guilt. And when you blink and they're 18 going out the door, looking back at you saying, ""Really, Mom, it's fine. It was all fine,"" know that you might feel a little better about your glaring absence, but you can never get those years back.Anything worthwhile takes time and sacrifice -- human lives being at the top of the list. Are you ready to commit? At the very least, read this book and THEN decide."

Thus by default, investigative journalists such as himself become the all-critical truth seekers.Such a placement undoubtedly echoes Watergate, but unlike then the newspapers of record have been silent as the Bush administration more or less does whatever it wanted. According to Lindorff, the 'snafus' which make the mainstream media really were not accident at all. They are part of the Bush administration's concerted targeting of political dissenters.Being an investigative journalist is not at all glamorous, but Lindorff helps the American people find out what their government is up to.

0787901733,Managing with the Wisdom of Love: Uncovering Virtue in People and Organizations,40,A221QEVPHNU387,Leo H. Tramm,,4,1019865600,LEFT ME NEEDING MORE!,"Dorothy Marcic's Managing with the Wisdom of Love is founded on the premise that an organization should seek balance in the five dimensions of work, which include physical, intellectual, emotional, volitional, and spiritual. The author models these dimensions as the parts of a tree, with each dimension represented as follows:- Roots = Volitional- Trunk = Emotional- Branches = Intellectual- Leaves = PhysicalThe unseen water and nutrients necessary for the tree to survive represent spiritual qualities such as justice, respect, dignity, and the ability to love. These spiritual qualities are intended to form the foundation of an organization's philosophy and are the basis of the New Management Principles of trustworthiness, unity, respect and dignity, justice, and service and humility, suggested by the author.The author provides examples where some of the New Management Principles have been incorporated into struggling organizations. Stepwise approaches to assessing the current status of an organization and for integrating spirituality into an organization are also provided. However, my criticism of the book is framed by a statement made by the author --that trustworthiness is at the foundation of the problems associated with management change efforts. By the lack of detailed supporting research and thorough documentation of successes within organizations, the author forces the reader to take a leap of faith as to weather or not to trust in the concepts contained in the book. The impasse here is, of course, that spirituality is an intangible that cannot be seen or measured. Essentially, the author paints an abstract picture of utopia where realism may be needed.The concepts provided by the author are consistent with contemporary viewpoints on ethics, motivation, teambuilding, leadership, and the management of diversity. Authors of theory and text on these subjects offer similar views and suggest that the path to a successful organization is through the balanced application of principles similar to those suggested by the authorThe underlying message of the book, to treat and respect others as we would wish for ourselves, is arguably the single most important goal we should set for our personal and professional lives. Certainly the concept of applying this principle in a work environment will be met by a fair share of skeptics, as acknowledged by the author (`in the end, about 30% of participants will be transformed to some degree, 50% will be open to future experiences but not yet transformed, and about 20% will be against the transformation process or simply will not care'), but what management change effort isn't met with skepticism. The success/failure rates of other of other management programs may be comparable, because it takes a visionary team of leaders to lay the foundation necessary to see these concepts permeate a large organization. The concepts presented by the author also seem to be the first to be thrown out the door in a time of crisis. Open your mind and heart and take in the message the author is trying to deliver and it will enrich you, the people you work with, and maybe even society as a whole."

0801867053,"Assisted Living: Needs, Practices, and Policies in Residential Care for the Elderly",60,A170KHJUKCWPAS,T. McRae,1,5,1126483200,Defining Assisted Living,"As a lay person anticipating residence in Assisted Living before all is said and done, I wanted to find out just what it is, how to evaluate it, and what pitfalls and protections await the residents. I had read Internet articles suggesting that there are problems with defining Assisted Living, that protection for residents varies from state to state, and that variations are great, even within states. Mr. Lawton's work, combined with B. Schwarz's Aging, Autonomy, and Architecture: Advances in Assisted Living, managed to provide me either with the answers or with an explanation of why there are still so many unanswered questions. Lawton's Needs, Practices and Policies in Residential Care for the Elderly presents the results of studies and investigations in a number of states, one a potential retirement destination of mine. Both volumes deal with the issue of ""aging in place,"" which turns out to be an urgently important concept to those whose needs might be better served by skilled care (nursing) but an often unwelcome practice to those residents not wishing to be surrounded by the very frail. What happens to those wishing to age in place but who are unable to do so without risk to themselves? What are the issues of liability, as regards the institution? Marketing departments promote the concept of living in a ""homelike"" atmosphere, but architectural design has traditionally been dictated, and often still is, by practical needs and has been patterned after a ""medical"" (hospital-like) model, as is the typical nursing home. In the nursing model, the lack of independence and the hospital-like appearance of the establishment apparently contribute to the depression and despair of many residents. What kinds of building styles lend themselves better to the creation of a more homelike atmosphere? Mr. Lawton's studies deal with most of these issues, and his conclusions tend to confirm the information of the other text. The difference? Mr. Lawton's work, as suggested, is based upon studies executed in several states. Mr. Schwarz has compiled a text containing a variety of articles by respected experts in the field from around the country. Both books are valuable because they arrive at many similar conclusions, using different approaches. Mr. Lawton's is a hardback text, perhaps one that more easily fits the bookshelf. But both are excellent, and both enabled me to have a well-informed interview with an assisted living administrator. The lay reader can appreciate these texts by reading attentively, and the elder care administrator will undoubtedly find well-documented discussion and many names familiar to those in the field -- features that would make this a worthwhile text in the office."

0939495805,The Picture of Dorian Gray,26,A2OIKYKLBOQ8RU,Narada,1,4,1200441600,A philosophical inquest into deleterious effects of sinful and vulgar living,"The Story:Dorian Gray is an adonis who is reminded or rather made attentive to his own beauty by a gentle artist friend (or lover) of his, Basil Hallward, who makes a breathtaking portrait of Gray. The portrait eventually becomes a favorite with Dorian, which also mirrors, in its painted face a sombre reflection of his own misdeeds and immoralities -- each time he commits it -- by growing uglier and uglier. He guards it with extreme care and caution everyday wanting none to see it found marred by his iniquities. Early in the story Dorian happens to meet with a reckless rich man, Lord Henry, a friend of Basil, who cares not a tithe for morality and its dull unattractive ways but believes in living life to the fullest at any cost. He preaches hedonism as sacred and purity a sin. Both Lord Henry and Dorian take an instant liking towards each other the day they meet. This friendship has an obvious deleterious effect on Dorian in that he kills himself repentantly after realising the worthlessness of his having lived a pompous, immoral, wicked and greedy life. Just before the story ends, he kills his well-wisher Basil too.How the story is arranged:Initially, the first few chapters seem to move fast and the story gains momentum. Just as the reader becomes inquisitive, a dull tone appears making the following chapters languorous. Wilde becomes a bit didactic in elaborating on the various interests Dorian picks on in his later adult life. Also, as one naturally imagines Dorian as a young lad, we then suddenly find him a thirties something in the last few chapters without a clear and smooth manifestation of this transition from adolescence to manhood. Most of Dorian's life is sinfully adventurous and in spite of that is portrayed quite uninterestingly. No events are specifically narrated upon and the emphasis on homosexuality can be smoothly sidelined. Overall, the story is good only if viewed as a philosophical inquest into human nature. Anything beyond that may disappoint the reader.Relevance, Reflections and Conclusion:The entire story is a narration of essentially how importantly one's mind makes one's personality, how one's personality makes one's deeds, and how in turn those deeds make one's soul. Of course we do not really fashion our soul, we only help it manifest it through our deeds. Gray's character is a reflection of the kind of narcissist weaklings in humanity who lack the courage to face their dark corners, while constantly finding strength and support in being mentored (actually misled) by feckless perverse people, like Lord Henry here, who lead them increasingly towards moral obscurity. How different the world would be if each one of us could reason out ""responsibly"" all that seems perverse and sacred, and yet not give in to anything perverse or sacred until one has found it true himself! I have also found the concept of blame game in this story very interesting. Do we not often dutifully blame others for our own darkness and failures, just as Dorian Gray blames his friend Basil Hallward for turning him into a deplorable narcissist? A responsible man always shares the burden of his own actions, rather than carelessly and callously point fingers at others -- a good lesson to learn! The story also raises deep philosophical arguments at every nook and corner if one plunges deep into the characters of the story attentively. Simple sentences like ""Nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing"" had me thinking and I found it strongly relevant in today's consumeristic hegemony. There are many more such dialogues which raise questions about the importance of femininity, marriage, purity, aestheticism and so on. Anyhow, to read it for its ""own sake"", or to try to finish it in a hurry, will certainly make it very boring and tiresome. But for those who inveterately love to question and investigate the world they live in with its various dogmas, theologies, philosophies and doctrines either propagating or thrashing morality, this book makes an interesting read. Since I do not possess a bent of mind that appreciates a tragic ending, -- I consider human life very precious --, I was sorely disappointed to see the protagonist, Dorian Gray, dead in the end. In fact I find this style of defeatist writing/ending a flaw in itself though it appeals to many. Plainly, if I were the author, I would have given my protagonist a new life, a new philosophy, a new guidance, and a new hope. HOPE...without which the entire humanity cannot exist."

However, this book is well-timed as it contains much revisionist history about the Arab-israeli conflict. For example, the Israeli government in 2002 finally declassified documents that showed that the Mossad funded and helped create Hamas to destabalize the PLO and fragment the Palestinians with a ""homegrown, religious alternative."" Shimon Peres has come forward and testified to this and it is undisputed fact.This book in no way favors the Palestinians. It gives equal time to discussing the sycophantic leaders who have allowed Arafat to stay in power and disrupt the peace process at nearly every turn. The main purpose of this book, though, is to provide a clear argument for the sake of evaluating the possibility of the refugees returning to their lands in Israel. It discusses very eloquently through several articles how such a return would actually work to the advantage of both the Israeli and Palestinian peoples. This book is a major-policy read, so you won't find much propaganda. This book is not for the lightly attentive. There are many details and a lot of governmental and diplomatic language involved. Not for the light reader.This book also contains one of the last articles that renowned academic and Nobel Peace Prize winner Edward Said wrote before he lost his battle to lukemia this past year.

Just a few ideas are given here and then repeated and repeated and repeated. The authors give very simplified and basic instructions about guide training in a way that can be useful only for schoolteachers in remote areas of Africa.For instance, they suggest a procedure, which begins with the following operation: ""Begin the session with an open discussion. Ask the class: What is material culture? If the class know what it is, ask them to name examples of material culture, both generally and at the site. If they are not familiar with the term (?!?), give a quick accurate definition: material culture is anything shaped by human hands"".An another example is the authors' suggestion to trainers about how to prepare their class on ""Identifying the Site's Topics"". They say: ""Assemble materials. Flip chart pages developed during Activity 2.1 (tape to walls or make available for people to see). Easel, flip chart, and markers of at least four colors."" For God's sake, it's about the guide training for conducting historical tours and not about kindergarten activities!The whole text of approx. 150 pages twirls around a basic idea that 'a great tour' is based on several elements such as storylines, themes, physical evidence, biography of historic personalities and historical context.

Unlike most other fictional heroines of the day, Edna isn't rescued by a handsome stranger; instead, she virtually abandons husband and children to seek her own bliss. Sure, there's another man in the picture--men actually, but Chopin's startlingly vivid prose is not employed for pat endings. Carried away by her own internal music and by the sea itself, Edna begins to live life on her own terms.The book was squashed by male critics of the time because of its positively racy subject matter. A St. Louis reviewer even went so far as to label it unhealthy. Sadly, the infamy marked the end of the author's brief career. Rediscovered only in the last twenty or thirty years, Chopin's brand of vivid lyricism and captivating imagery is not to be missed."

They are original, authentic characters in every sense of the word. Although their relationship was evidently established in a prior story that I have not read (but intend to), it comes across as endearing. The intensely accurate portrayal of life in a restaurant kitchen is as entertaining as it is informative. The flavor of New Orleans, arguably the oddest city in the United States, is as strong as absinthe. But this is not a perfect novel. Most egregious are the gratuitous violence and lack of anything other than superficial remorse for it. The Lenny character has way too much time on his hands for all of the business interests he is supposed to have going and his actions are hard to reconcile with his personality. The Mike character has no credibility nor does his fantastically coincidental family tie-in to Rickey's and G-man's restaurant. But apart from this, the rest of the writing, especially the dialogue, makes this an enjoyable read. I'll have a second shot of Liquor in the next book in the series."

Adams rightly states that the existence of Northern Ireland is Bonar Law's greatest achievement.

0976057549,Taj,14.95,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,Jeffrey Leach,1,5,1119052800,Delicious,"A novel about the Taj Mahal better be good--no, scratch that; it better be great. That's because the structure Mughal emperor Shah Jahan built to celebrate his deceased wife Mumtaz Mahal stands as one of the great wonders of the world. His heartrending loss has turned into humanity's gain. If you don't believe me, look up some pictures on the Internet. Words like ""incredible,"" ""divine,"" ""breathtaking,"" and ""soul stirring"" simply fail to capture the essence of the remarkable mausoleum. This monument to love transcends life itself, which was exactly the effect Jahan sought back in the seventeenth century. So take a look at the pictures or, if you're lucky, hop on a plane and go see the place. Then report back here and pick up a copy of Sandra Wilson's ""Taj."" This fictional account of the rise and fall of Shah Jahan--bursting with court intrigues, jealousies, love, and loss all wrapped up in prose that often soars to Olympian heights--is a book that honors the emotions the Mughal emperor wished to impart with his architectural triumph. The condensed version of this overly gushing paragraph is simply this: ""Taj"" is a book readers with an interest in historical fiction should read. Even those who pass over historical fiction ought to give it a look.Wilson brings us into the story in 1666 as Shah Jahan lies on his deathbed recalling the sweet memories of his wife. He's no longer emperor thanks to his scheming son Aurangzeb, who deposed his father some eight years prior and sentenced him to confinement in the palace at Agra. With only his dutiful daughter Jahanara to keep him company, Shah Jahan's final years are ones of peace and reflection. Then we get the story, and what a story it is. It's now 1614 as Mumtaz and her husband Prince Khurram (Shah Jahan's title before assuming the throne) journey to the Moonlight Mahal, a secret garden owned by a friend, where the two revel in each other's company. The young prince is the favorite of his father Jahangir, the fourth Mughal emperor, and the monarch's powerful and scheming wife Nur Jahan. Khurram is charismatic, capable, and intelligent--everything a future emperor of a vast and growing empire needs to succeed. He's also young and headstrong, hoping to put to the test his abilities and thus secure a guarantee to the throne. Khurram gets his chance when his father sends him off to campaign against a group of troublemakers in a region called Rajasthan. His overwhelming victory there coupled with his father's fawning adoration soon turns Nur Jahan against the young prince.Nur Jahan's snub of Khurram enrages our hero, and it's not too long before the two are engaged in open warfare to see who will sit on the throne. Jahangir's wife cannot rule herself since she's a woman, but she can exercise power through Khurram's dimwitted half-brother if she can convince her husband to disavow his favorite son. Tragically, her plans initially succeed to the point where Khurram feels he must attack the capital with his own forces in an attempt to seize the throne. Throughout all of these events Mumtaz dutifully stands by her husband, bearing him many children while offering sage political advice and unconditional love. A fascinating digression in the story concerning a villager named Chundar seeking justice from Shah Jahan serves as a sort of bridge to the second half of the story that describes the tragic demise of Mumtaz Mahal and Shah Jahan's efforts to pick up the pieces and move on. Enter the construction of the Taj Mahal, a project that takes twenty-two years to complete. Wilson describes in intricate detail the high level of craftsmanship necessary in building one of the world's greatest architectural triumphs. She also turns the building into a metaphysical experience between Shah Jahan and Allah. Fascinating stuff.My complaints with the book are few, namely the too tight binding that makes the pages difficult to turn and an occasional typo that sometimes interrupts the flow of the story. These are nitpicky, niggling concerns, however, that should not prevent anyone from reading this book. The narrative is definitely homerun material, especially the second part of the story. Wilson knows how to write engaging prose that will have you reaching for a hanky when Mumtaz passes away. She also knows how to write VERY piquant scenes involving Mumtaz and Shah Jahan hooking up in the Moonlight Mahal. It's a rare book that can evoke such dissimilar emotions, but ""Taj"" pulls it off beautifully. Like the other reviewer here, I also read John Shors's ""Beneath a Marble Sky,"" and I must say I appreciated the chance to read a story about roughly the same time period, one that deals with many of the same characters and issues, but from a markedly different perspective.The caption under a picture of the author on the back cover of the book tells us that she spent time teaching courses at the American International School in New Delhi, and that it was during this time that she decided to find out more about the Taj Mahal. Wilson obviously did her research. I think the best compliment that I can offer to this author and her book is that I hope and pray a major publisher picks ""Taj"" up, runs off a bunch of copies, and throws a lot of money into marketing the story to the masses. I know fans of historical fiction would love to give this one a shot, but even readers that know little about history will indubitably find something of interest here. Action, romance, tragedy, love, redemption--""Taj"" has it all and more. Definitely give this one a shot if you get the chance."

While reading the book I often had some of my previous notions clarified in a very unambiguous way. Also the annexed texts are interesting and there are a lot of them.

I feel that I have a better understanding of Taoism, and I am now eager to read more about it. What's interesting is that I have a four year old niece who loves Winnie the Pooh, and when we watch the cartoon together, I also now have new, grown-up insight into it, which makes it more fun for me too!The book is quick - in fact, I found it a bit too short - and easy to read. I admit, it could've been a bit more in-depth. I'm sure critics who say this is a very superficial examination of Taoism are probably right. However, I don't know that this criticism is particularly important. I think Hoffman's purpose was simply to whet the reader's appetite so that they'd be motivated to do more study of Taoist philosophy. If I'm correct in this belief, he was successful, at least in my case."

But I am not sure it adds anything important to chess literature. I could say that about any chess book (and my wife certainly would!), but my point is this: it is one of the many chess books that tries to make its point negatively. That is, its examples say, ""look, here he didn't see the danger, and lost, etc."" There is not corresponding (positive) instruction on how to avoid the danger. Another way of saying this. Say it was a book on war, called ""Danger in War."" It is full of examples showing, for instance, a soldier standing up instead of crouching in his foxhole. He thus gets wounded or killed. This book says, by using examples in this way, ""see, that was dangerous."" This is interesting, but I can easily look at my own games and find plenty of examples of me succumbing in dangerous positions. So, why do I need this book? That said, the examples are good, the writing is good, and the chapter titles (thought-related factors, position-related factors) are interesting, but I can't help but wonder why a book like this does not have more instructional content."

He was hired by right wing conservatives to write a ""hit piece"" on Hillary Clinton; but while doing the research for the book, he found that most of the rumors about Clinton either had no evidence or had been debunked. He relays the story in his book ""Blinded by the Right: Conscience of an Ex-Conservative"".Now, years later, the ultra right wing have found another author (not journalist) to attack Clinton. They found an author who did such a terrible job that moderate, and even some extreme, conservatives have distanced themselves from this embarrassing work. Countless flaws and deceptions have been pointed out in this book (see link below).I am an independent, and not really a fan of Hillary; but my opinion is based on her voting record. Not a thrash novel that attacks her personal life. What is the point of unfounded personal attacks in politics? I can maybe understand them if they exploit policy hypocrisy (e.g. a gay governor voting against gay rights, a ""support the troops"" congressperson voting to cut military benefits, etc.) I question those who have a ""winning team"" political mentality. I don't care about the (R) or the (D) after their name, I care about their voting record and policy.

These people like authors to create beautiful scenes for them that they can forever conjure up in their heads. For this kind of reader, The Picture of Dorian Gray is probably a pleasure. Unfortunately, I am not this kind of reader.It is perhaps fitting that a book about beauty is defined by the images it creates rather than by the story or the dialogue. However, Oscar Wilde's mastery of dialogue is what makes his plays such a pleasure. For me, The Picture of Dorian Gray will never live up to Wilde's plays. This is not to say that the book is completely irredeemable; whenever Lord Henry is around, the book becomes better (but only insofar as it becomes more like a play, more focused on dialogue).You will love this book if you like descriptions, if you, unlike me, were able to read the chapters of The Grapes of Wrath that rambled about the land and that did not contribute to the plot. If you are like me, on the other hand, this book will be readable but not particularly enjoyable."

Well, this book is like that, but for 16 chapters. They devote soooo much time to re-writing song lyrics that mock XP that you almost become embarrased for them.

Her major point is that the great variety of choices we now have in many areas of life, increase our freedom and happiness. In the course of arguing in this way she makes an implicit argument for the intelligence and reason of most people. They will not spend years worrying about a choice in any area which means nothing to them. They will not spend years choosing a new product when they already have one in this particular line that suits them.Still despite Postrel strong arguments(And there are others)it is clear that Barry Schwartz has touched upon a central and important theme of human life in our time. The excess of choices and options within an area and between areas mean that we are often left confused and disturbed.Here however I think that there is another point that Postrel makes which Schwartz is also aware of i.e. that being experienced in a particular realm teaches us how to cut out whole areas which otherwise would have disturbed us. I think a very good example for myself is in dealing with the Internet where it is possible to chase for hours one kind of misleading path to no- solution of the problem. With experience comes a knowledge of areas of interest, of sites that can be relied on, on how to use our time wisely.However it does seem to me that there is a major cultural point about the nature of humanity, which is given in this world of superabundanct choice. I may be wrong but it seems to me that most people today are more scattered, more disordered and less able to really concentrate for long hours on one task. That is to say the whole background of our lives is endless distractions which make it difficult for us to shut ourselves off, and concentrate for the best type of work.This is a thought- provoking work . I have unfortunately touched upon only a small number of the problems and choices in thought it raises."

James and Harriet Blackstone have left Norfolk, England, to make a new life in the South island of New Zealand. They have built a somewhat makeshift house called the Cob and are prepared to eke out a subsistence from the mixed though meagre blessings that the land and climate can offer. Their marriage might not be loveless, but often both have to search very deep indeed to find something that might approach their individually desired contentment. There is a history we learn, especially on Joseph's side, a history in Norfolk which may have prompted the decision to leave.While her husband is hard-working, he is rather secretive by nature. Harriet, on the other hand, is patient, diligent and long-suffering. She is also innovative, strong and honest. She relates to her mother-in-law, Lillian, who has accompanied them to their new lives, and to her neighbours, whose little son becomes especially important in her own childless life. Joseph's mother, meanwhile, will clearly never settle in these unfamiliar surroundings and there are tensions to overcome.When news of gold in the region stimulate a rush, Joseph stakes a claim, hides his interests in the same way that he hides his emotions, and tries to make his fortune. Eventually his independence, his insistence on self-reliance, becomes his downfall. His life amongst the other prospectors and the suppliers of services that are attracted to their needs is beautifully described.Harriet, however, is eventually more resourceful. She takes it upon herself to trace a Maori girl whose input to a little boy's life could prove crucial. Her search takes her across cultures as well as across the landscape and, eventually, she discovers things of her own, things that endure.The Colour is a beautiful book that does not, however, achieve the total success it promises. Somehow, its whole is rather less than the sum of its parts. The tale and its characters are all beautifully drawn, but the historical perspective, the feel for landscape and the crossing of culture all fall a little short. These are minor criticisms, however, of a thoroughly enjoyable read."
1400043468,My Life in France,18.45,A2F6N60Z96CAJI,Bookreporter,1,5,1147305600,A delightful and fascinating read,"In her memoir, we discover that Julia Child was not born with a wooden spoon in her hand; her early cooking experiences were sometimes less than delectable. Her adventures, culinary and otherwise, are chronicled in amazing detail and much charm, written with Alex Prud'homme, Paul Child's grandnephew.The book opens with an introductory first sentence from Julia that speaks for itself:""This is a book about some of the things I have loved most in life: my husband, Paul Child; la belle France; and the many pleasures of cooking and eating.""The story begins as Paul and Julia move to Paris after two years in Washington, D.C. Thirty-six-year-old Julia has mixed feelings about the move. She fears that the quiet, stylish, mannerly, and tiny French would be aghast at a six-foot-two-inch ""rather loud and unserious Californian."" However, almost instantly Julia is enamored of France and its people. She delights in her first French meal, sheepishly telling her husband she doesn't know what a shallot is. The description of that first meal, and the many following, is as loving as if she were describing her firstborn.Julia begins to cook a bit, helped by French friends who show her the best places to shop and introduce her to new foods such as snails and truffles. As her food consciousness rises, her ability to speak French also improves. Her next step is to sign up for a year-long course at the famed cooking school, Cordon Bleu, where she discovers a true passion for French cooking (she calls it her ""personal calling""). She also realizes she has much to learn --- she can't even scramble eggs properly. Indeed, even as she grows more knowledgeable, she continues making cooking errors, resulting in bizarre dishes.Julia's passion for cooking extends beyond school. At home, she experiments, making batch after batch of mayonnaise and other dishes. She begins to write down recipes. After graduation (she fails her first final exam and has to take it over), Julia joins two women in opening a small cooking school. The three begin collaboration on a cookbook that, after countless publishing disappointments and rejections over many years, would eventually become MASTERING THE ART OF FRENCH COOKING, a classic that would change cooking in the United States forever.Julia and Paul move to Marseille and then to Germany, finally moving back to Washington, D.C. Everywhere, they find adventure, friends, and delicious food. Julia, of course, becomes a celebrity chef, starring in her own television series and writing several books.In MY LIFE IN FRANCE, Julia emphasizes ""the importance of including fun and love in the preparation of a meal!"" Both elements are abundant ingredients in this book as well. Aided in their research by a mountain of family letters and Paul Child's photos, some of which illustrate the book, each anecdote is detailed and lavishly described. Julia's voice shines through; she appears as she seemed in life, refreshingly unselfconscious, willing to poke fun at herself, and full of passion (and aren't we fortunate to experience Julia Child once again now, after her death in 2004? Many thanks to Alex Prud'homme. Without his nudging and brilliant work, we would miss out on this late-served and much-appreciated dessert).It all adds up to a delightful and fascinating read. In fact, I give it the ultimate book reviewer's compliment: I'm keeping my copy in order to reread it. Highest recommendation.--- Reviewed by Terry Miller Shannon (terryms2001@yahoo.com)"

I am currently enroled in an Abnormal Psychology Class and read this book for one of our final examinations. This book is basically about a young woman by the name of Silvia Fumpkin. Silvia's life is quite dramatic as we follow her through her battle with schizophrenia. From her ups and downs, we see what types of deviant behaviors schizophrenics participate in. From stripping off her clothes, to attempting to swallow an ashtray are scenes we see in this book. Through out the book we also see Silvia being admitted from hospital to hopital and the switch from medication to medication. Due to her illness, she shares the pain of being in a Jewish family and bringing shame on to her family. Her behavior at times is very interesting as you observe how she thinks she's Jesus one minute and Paul Macartney's wife the next minute. Although there are times where you may feel like the pages just seem to go on and on, this book is most definately a good read hence I strongly encourage readers who are interested in schizophrenia to read this book. Not only is it an interesting read but you learn so much about those who suffer from schizophrenia as well as the way society treats or acts towards schizophrenics."

Krul,1,4,1146960000,"The ""No Logo"" of anti-capitalism","Yates' book ""Naming the System"" is a valiant attempt to explain the failures, contradictions and problems of modern globalized capitalism in terms understandable to every layman. By and large, he has succeeded, though there are some flaws.His strongest point is reconciling the arguments against the orthodox neoclassical theory of ""more free markets = better"" with the 'facts on the ground', in the form of valuable statistics and examples from practical experience. He enthousiastically destroys the reformist view of capitalism as followed by many social-democrats and current-day labor union leaders just as much as the libertarian approach. In addition to that, he gives a worthwhile overview of the Marxist interpretation of capitalism and why it is better able to explain certain commonplace phenomena in firm practice than the neoclassicals. Finally, he gives a non-too-critical overview of the great variety of leftist anti-capitalist movements in the world today and some general perspectives on their success, though all this is very vague.The books great benefits are the easy to understand ways in which he shows the workings of capitalism in the many kinds of injustice felt by (young) leftist-inclined people, giving them a more solid ground for their critiques. However, this accessible approach is also the big downside to Yates' work: ""Naming the System"" is not in-depth at all, its wording is a little simplistic and childish sometimes, and it is virtually useless to those who already have a basic Marxist understanding of the capitalist world. Nevertheless, the book is worth four stars for its excellent utility as an education book on the Marxist approach for young people (high school and students), much like Naomi Klein's book was for the anti-branding movement."

She looks towards others to help her feel 'safe', but nearly everyone in her life betrays her in some way.In Rhy's eloquent style of writing, we are smoothly transported into the atmosphere of Jamaica after the 1830's. Though Antoinette is clearly a victim, I found Christophene's character refreshing and empowered. She's a former slave who is feared because of her knowledge of 'Obeah'. She isn't afraid to stand up to Antoinette's white husband, and comes close to helping the young woman re-gain her freedom. In my opinion, had the story ended with Mr. Rochester allowing his creole wife to remain in Jamaica under Christophene's care, Antoinette's broken heart would have mended and the signs of madness vanished. But because his troubled bride is treated as a 'possession', he takes her away from all that she loves, refuses to return any of her family fortune, and shreds her last piece of identity by calling her Bertha instead of her given name. Is this reader sorry that Thornfield Hall was burned to the ground? Not after digesting the first Mrs. Rochester's version of the story, so masterfully written by Jean Rhys.Chrissy K.

1594676739,Before the Season Ends,18.99,A3LKA3I6Z5FIJM,Wyn,,4,1229731200,Reviewed for FIRST Wild Card Tour at [...],"It was a pleasant change to read a Regency romance without a lot of sexual tension and innuendos. Burkard has the era down pat and it was easy to visualize the scenes as well as sympathize with the heroine. I also found her characteristics true to a 19 year old rather than a wishy-washy attempt to provide the character with teen emotions that weren't of the time and adult emotions that were beyond her age as so many authors do with girls of that age in different time periods.Ariane is a determined 19 year old second daughter who has decided that her lot in life is to marry someone in the church. Her family is well educated in the meaning behind the Bible verses and she has the intelligence to engage in theoretical theology while at the same time the faith in what she believes to be correct. She knows the difference between being a real Christian and being a church Christian. Because the only church man in her village is over 60 her parents decide to send her to live with her aunt in London who has offered to sponser their oldest daughter to a London season. The aunt is not prepared for a young girl who knows her mind and isn't influenced nor really interested in the social circles and Ariane isn't prepared for an aunt whose only interest is the social life of the ton. It makes for some interesting personality clashes and character development.Burkard has spent the last couple of chapters detailing the thoughts behind the idea that becoming a Christian and developing a Christian lifestyle has nothing to do with deeds and all to do with inviting God into your heart. She has done this in a manner true to the story and not preachy, it doesn't seem out of place at all and I really don't think that someone not schooled in the idea would find it out of place with the story.I give this book 4 stars."

The central message of each ""affie"" (Be a Loving Person, Take Time to be Alone, Seek Support from Others) is listed at the top of the page. It is followed by a quote from either the authors or a teen. Then comes the body, consisting of a paragraph, which elaborates on the central theme. At the bottom is a ""Taste-Berry Promise"", which encourages the reader to do things such as ""walk an elderly neighbor's dog"" or ""tell a friend something he or she doesn't know about what I believe in"".Rinse and repeat 364 times. That's the whole book.No stories of men hiking alone in the wilderness, who get attacked by mountain lions, get their legs chewed off, and have to crawl 50 miles back to civilization, just to get a beer. Now that's inspiration.Though this book is supposedly targeted towards teens, I genuinely believe that most of us would rather spoon out our eyeballs than waste our time reading this crap. What else can you expect from a ""bestselling series"".

0452265347,The Piano Lesson,9.28,A9TG2NFA614S9,John F. Rooney,1,5,1248393600,Vibrant Characters in His Pittsburgh Cycle,"""The Piano Lesson"" (1990) by the late August Wilson is part of his ten-play series, the Pittsburg Cycle or the Century Cycle. It focuses on a frequent literary device--a family feud over money, land, or personal property. In this case it's a piano that has carved into its surface a history of the family. Berniece and her brother Boy Willie are battling over possession of the piano. Boy Willie with his buddy, ne'er-do-well Lymon, has brought a truckload of watermelons up from the South to Pittsburgh to peddle, hoping to sell them and also sell the family piano so he can buy a spread of land down South.This story takes place in the 1930's when the blacks are still living in a South where white people oppressed blacks and where no law existed to intervene for blacks. Boy Willie wants a white man's land, Sutter's spread. Sutter fell down a well, and he may or may not have been assisted in that fall by Boy Willie.Berniece and her daughter live with her uncle Doaker, a cook for the railroad. He is the voice of reason. She is seeing Avery who wants to set up a church and is the voice of religion and prophecy. Various characters such as Wining Boy play the piano briefly and there are occasional songs. The ghost of Sutter is present at times in the play, and later his spirit plays a pivotal role. As the action of the play continues, all sorts of family memories and history are revealed.August Wilson was a risk-taker who asked audiences to come along with him as he dealt with questions of ownership, possession, and family disputes while at the same time presenting a very accessible story with flashes of humor, large doses of humanity, and a dramatic structure with a beginning, middle and end. It's about as far from Absurdist theater as you can get.Wilson created real people in a believable setting. There's a vibrance and a vitality to the people and a sound dramatic structure with a good set-up, development and climax. They are not phony people or cardboard figures. There's a touching homey quality to the play.One of my favorite haunts in Manhattan is the Edison Caf&eacute;, a diner-type restaurant off the lobby in the Edison Hotel on 47th Street. Fondly known as the Polish Tea Room by its habitu&eacute;s, this was where Wilson was reputed to have written notes for three of his plays on restaurant napkins."

0441012620,Rule of Evidence (JAG in Space #3),7.99,A1I2O9Y3X3HXLS,Arthur W. Jordin,1,5,1174435200,Remember the Maury,"Rule of Evidence (2006) is the third SF novel in the JAG in Space series, following Burden of Proof. In the previous volume, Commander Carr convinced the courtmartial board that Lieutenant Scott Silver was negligent in his duties. Admiral Silver was very upset with Paul Sinclair over the conviction of his son.In this novel, the South Asian Alliance is pushing even harder against other spacegoing nations and federations. In response, US and European politicians have conceived of a way to demonstrate the strength of their space navies. The USS Michaelson will participate in joint maneuvers with the USS Maury, the British HMS Lord Nelson, the Franco-German ship Alsace and the Russian ship Pyotr Veleki.A SASAL warship disrupts these maneuvers, but draws back when the British ship threatens to ram them. Afterward, the spatial maneuvers are successful, but have little influence on SASAL. The US tries another way of showing the flag, ordering the Michaelson and Maury to approach the perimeter of the SASAL zone under maximum stealth and then suddenly becoming very visible to the SASAL sensors.The approach to the perimeter is accomplished with commendable precision, but the Maury suddenly explodes after the stealth systems are shut down. The Michaelson sends damage control parties over to the Maury to conduct rescue and reinforcement of the hull. Apparently the engineering spaces have been thoroughly destroyed and most of the engineering crew killed in the explosions.Paul leads one damage control team. When he sees the destruction, Paul is convinced that Jen Shen -- an engineering officer on the Maury and his significant other -- is dead. While concentrating on his duties, he is able to hold back his feelings, but afterwards he becomes despondent. Shortly after returning to his ship, Paul receives a message from the Maury that Jen is still alive.In this story, the Maury incident becomes a media sensation and soon is blamed on the SASAL. Thorough investigation of the ship and personnel rules out external attack or sabotage. Moreover, the experts cannot conceive of any way that the explosions could have occurred by accident. Someone on the ship must have caused the explosions.When Jen is arrested for sabotaging her own ship, Paul searches for alternative answers. Since she is the only survivor among the engineering crew, everything Jen says is unprovable. Although those who really know her are convinced that she is innocent, everyone else assumes that she is guilty as accused. Jen is already suffering from survivors guilt and now is beginning to believe that she somehow caused the disaster.Jen's father is away on patrol and her mother died long ago. Now she only has Paul, but she is beginning to lash out at him in an unconscious effort to determine whether he too will abandon her. Luckily Paul has a few friends who counsel him during this crisis.The author uses the Maine incident as a historical example of shaping public opinion toward war. Many historians believe that Randolph Hearst caused the Spanish-American war through the sensational coverage of this affair in his newspapers. Remember the Maine became a rallying cry for that war.Highly recommended for Hemry fans and for anyone else who enjoy tales of naval affairs, legal ploys and personal crises.-Arthur W. Jordin"

Chapters denounce the harm caused by the neocon Republican party, and describe what needs to be done to promote grass-roots opposition within the Democratic party; the authors are quite realistic about the limits of a two-party system, and offer means to reform the Democratic party as the swiftest and most practical way to improve American government. Topics covered include the importance of campaign finance reform, a trough that both Democrats and Republicans feed off of all too frequently; the unfortunate prevalence of unrealistic visions and ""single-issue"" obsessives within the Democratic party; the changing landscape of modern media; and much more. Enthusiastically recommended for anyone involved in grassroots politics."

I like reviews that mention similar books, at least books on the same path, so I do that. Books like this are a good start, and I was able to apply techniques right away. If you want a context for understanding this from the inside out, which is the only way to understand it, other books can be very helpful in the search to get out of the box of white man world.The Future Is Yours: Do Something About It!,Redneck Shaman,Lost Secrets of Ancient Hawaiian Huna, Volume 1,Theta Healing: Introducing an Extraordinary Energy Healing Modalitycan be helpful. There is a Sufi story about moths, and the only moth that really understands the candle is the one who gives himself totally to the light, and the light gives itself to him. This applies to shamanic work, and especially any kind of indigenous approaches to any kind of healing, especially psychological. Shamanic techniques work from the larger self, especially in service to others. Shamanism means working with the subconscious, and at times superconscious minds. It cannot be apprehended by the conscious mind, the ego. Without a solid intent of service to others, many things just don't work, or work only slightly.House of Shattering Light: Life as an American Indian Mystic, &Journey to the Ancestral Self: The Native Lifeway Guide to Living in Harmony With Earth Mother, Book 1 (Bk.1)are very good basic books, to getting out of the box of White Man culture. Wong Kiew Kit's books on Chi Kung show how ideas like this survive in Chinese culture. Western culture is lost in the literal, and won't look at the deeper meanings of its stories. Neville Goddard has ideas on this, as one example among many. This book is a good start, sort of like a tourist guide, or a textbook, to reflections from the subconscious mind.The Reality Creation Technique, andMatrix Energetics: The Science and Art of Transformationare also useful. Other writers say other things, that are useful, I won't repeat them. This book is well worth reading. Max Freedom LongSecret Science Behind Miraclesis useful. This book is a good start a practical how to, with stuff that will work right away- out of a context of service. All shamanic work is better when it is done from a context of service to humanity."

0299184900,Beijing: A Novel,26.95,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,"M. J Leonard ""MikeonAlpha""",0.8181818181818182,5,1064448000,A gay travel adventure where West meets East.,"David Masiello's trip to Beijing is the stuff made from heaven. This remarkable novel is structured around the four seasons, and we see the David's journey through the perspective of each changing season. Each section gives us just a little more insight into David's journey, as he gains confidence and gradually adjusts to living in a foreign culture. His story is fictional, but it could almost read as a non-fiction travelogue, and I suspect that much of what is written was gleaned from Gambone's own experiences traveling through China and living in Beijing.Living in Boston, stuck is a rut, pining for his dead boyfriend; David takes the initiative and applies for a job at a Western medical clinic in Beijing. Then his life changes forever as he confronts parts of himself, and goes on an exciting journey of self-discovery to become ""whole again.""Gambone masterfully takes us on David's journey from the nervous, worrying pre-flight preparation to the anxiousness and excitement of his first night and weeks in China. All the sights, sounds and smells of Beijing are seen through the prism of David's eyes - the eyes of an inexperienced and somewhat hesitant traveler. The trash on the streets, the drab colours of the University dorm that David is forced to sleep in, the food, the endless smog, the crowds of people cycling to work, the market stalls, the militaristic boy soldiers, the warmth of the people, and the furtiveness of Chinese gay life are all bought vividly to life.As David becomes more comfortable with the city, he also searches out the closeted gay life, which he knows must exist in the city. At night he cruises the local park in the hope of making contact with men; he finds the Ta Ta Club, a local watering hole for gay men, and he goes to a bathhouse, where gays are reported to furtively meet. During his year in Beijing he meets many interesting people and makes many good friends. And he also finds time for love with Bo, a handsome young Chinese artist, who makes him understand the limitless possibilities for love again.Anyone, gay or straight who has picked up and left familiarity, particularly anyone who had lived in another culture for an extended length of time, will find a lot to admire in this novel. The East/West divide is ever present, particularly the East's cultural attitudes to homosexuality. Traditional ""family values"" are ever present in this society: Auntie Chen, David's work mate constantly asks why he is not married and many of the young gay men David meets confess to him that they are under pressure from their parents to find a girl and marry. But the book also presents the the boarder theme of the new China - a China that's rapidly opening its borders to the West, and stumbling towards open markets and capitalism with differing degrees of success.

As I Lay Dying and Light in August are two of Faulkner's most accessible novels. The Sound and the Fury on the first read is somewhat trying but if you read it again EVERYTHING makes perfect sense and it is as accessible as pulp fiction crap. Faulker is not great because he is difficult to read; he is great because his novels, while being place-specific and tied intimately to north Mississippi, are universal. They speak to people of all cultures and backgrounds. They are poignant and beautiful. They are also scathing in their portrayal of American culture and ideology. Faulkner was way ahead of his times in terms of his view of race and even the environment (read Go Down, Moses). This is why Oprah picked the books. I can't realistically comprehend half of her normal reading/viewing audience actually reading these books, but if one person who otherwise would not have read Faulkner does, then Oprah has done a good thing."

I really did. It sounded so good! What could be better than a clear-headed, non-ideological look at such a controversial set of issues?Unfortunately, that's not this book. I read it as a rather more easily swayed 17- or 18-year-old, and even then I knew it was seriously off. Now that I've had more experience with scientific research, it's even worse.There are already a number of reviews pointing out the book's problems, so I'll just add one more. His argument for doing nothing about global warming rests entirely on the postulate that it will have negative effects, but it'll be ok, because we'll all be richer!Yes, really. He thinks that everyone will be richer in the future. Um...no. This can't be true. THIS CANNOT BE TRUE. Even if everyone made a higher dollar(/other currency) amount of income, this wouldn't make everyone richer. If everyone's incomes increased proportionately, everyone would still have the same sized slice of the metaphorical pie, and wouldn't actually be able to buy more.This is basic common sense! Inflation can't make everyone richer! It can make some people comparatively better off, but only at the expense of others.That was where the book broke for me.

It is unquestionably a good book, but as is most usually the case, best sellers are best sellers because of good selling and not because of superior content. A perfect example is the fact that the book -Managing at the Speed of Change- is one of the best books on managing and handling change ever (my opinion, of course) and yet -Who Moved My Cheese?- outsells it massively - even though there are not real practical processes and applications in the book. The same is true here.The big thing to remember is that this book is a good book, but is practically useless for small businesses in comparison to many others. Small businesses should look for books written by past and present small business owners that have been successful (and I don't me small business owners who own businesses that consult to small businesses; I mean small businesses that sell to consumers or B2B in a product or service realm other than business improvement). Harvey Mackay is a great example of someone who runs/ran a standard small business selling a product to people and businesses.Again, a good book for big business and a little benefit for others, but I wouldn't spend my time on this book if I had time to read ""just one"" this year."

1847022189,Jude the Obscure (Large Print),31.9,A10QG9SQBG4FLE,"""jacobika""",1,4,1037577600,Jude,"Jude the Obscure is a saddening book that deals with the oppression that society can force onto people. Jude Fawley's many attempts to rise above his social class and to become something better than he was born to are crushed time and again through society or the forces of nature. The writing itself is very readable; in the beginning of the book, I was very amused by how naive Jude was and enjoyed the way that Thomas Hardy used the language. The quality of writing never suffered through the book, but the plot becomes more and more depressing. In the final scene of the book, where Jude is finally dying after his life of oppression and tragedy, you feel incredibly sorry for all that Jude had to go through. Throughout his entire life he had been mocked by Christminster and all that it represented for Jude. Jude did all that he could to get there and become a scholar, but he was told to stay in his class and be content with what he had. Oppression through marriage of all of the main characters (Jude, Sue, Phillotson, and Arabella) was also explored through the entire book. Arabella is the mistake that Jude made that he cannot escape from. His one wrong choice early in his life ruins his chance for having a normal relationship with Sue, and in his final days he has to live with that choice. The underlying themes here are explored well by Hardy and give the reader a chance to see life from a different angle and hopefully appreciate what they have.One thing I disliked about the book was the constant tragic events. I understand that Hardy was trying to explore certain themes by using such depressing events, but it was too much sometimes. When little Father Time and the children of Jude and Sue died, I was probably as crushed as Sue was. That is perhaps the saddest point of any book that I have read and it caught me by surprise. The tragedy of it was much more than I was expecting, and that is probably what Hardy was looking for. I didn't appreciate being bombarded by such emotional manipulators by Hardy.The characterizations in the book were wonderful. Jude's aspirations that continued to be subverted by his weaknesses made him the perfect tragic hero. Sue was realistic, but she was never strong enough to earn my sympathy. She was just too weak, despite being the ""liberatedEwoman. I came to dislike Arabella right from the start, and my dislike grew with each appearance she made. Phillotson was perhaps the most pitiable character in the novel, especially when he is persecuted for letting Sue go. The minor characters in the story add to these main characters and help to reveal who that are and why they do what they do.Overall, Jude the Obscure is an excellent novel, but it does have its bad points. The thematic elements in the novel are explored in a thought-provoking way and the characters are portrayed in a realistic and poignant way that helps the reader to understand who they are and why they are being slammed by forces outside of their control. Those forces, though, are sometimes too strong and detract from what Hardy is trying to do with the novel. I would recommend this book, but be prepared to leave aside time to think about it afterwards. This book makes you sit down and think after you read it. If you don't do this afterwards, there will be so much that you miss."

0820323446,River of Lakes: A Journey on Florida's St. Johns River,16.98,A1J7E12SPV0BA4,David Lambert,,5,1303776000,In 'River of Lakes' and 'Salvaging the Real Florida': Author Bill Belleville Illuminates the Land He 'Kens',"by David LambertNorth Florida's St. Johns River is a troubled water. It crawls slowly northward through the top half of a troubled state. The river took shape in the Pleistocene-era Florida, nearly 65 million years ago, but it has taken humans only 400 years to change its nature--to harness its energy, redirect its flow, dredge its depth, widen its banks, pollute it with wastes and runoff, fill its floodplains, and draw down its water. New threats to the St. Johns River seem to pop up daily, so keeping tabs is a full-time job for researchers, enviro groups, scientists, and writers like Bill Belleville.About the only thing humans haven't managed to spoil is the character of the St. Johns. It's that special character that writer/naturalist Bill Belleville admires, and it's what he writes about with such grace and enthusiasm.Belleville's 2001 book on the St. Johns, River of Lakes, brought readers a new understanding of Florida's longest river. Others have told us how much North Floridians depend on and love the St. Johns; Belleville's book shows us why. River of Lakes helps demystify, and in fact often clarifies, the interconnectedness of man, land, and water. Its evokative prose derives from the author's special understanding of place.Belleville's words ring honest and true because he `kens' his subject, understands it at a nearly molecular level. One senses that he uncrated much about himself in the process of writing River of Lakes.Belleville's newest book, Salvaging the Real Florida, is an equally compellingly read. It's more about love of place than any book in recent memory. In the 10 or so years since he penned River of Lakes, Belleville's relationship with the natural world seems to have taken on an almost spiritual side, as though he were seeing natural Florida through the eyes of paleo-Natives, the Timuqua or Tequesta, the Calusa or Creek. Other times he's a scientist, examining Florida with magnifying glass in hand. Still others, he's a poet, a wordsmith who articulates and illuminates the wonders of the natural Florida with a lover's eye, but without the flower and fluffery that usually accompany books of this sort.Salvaging the Real Florida speaks of Belleville's understanding of the connectedness of man and the natural world. His is a near Shinto perspective of the benefits (and pleasures) derived when man immerses himself in nature, surrounding himself (or herself) with forests, sky, dirt, and water--forest bathing as the Shinto call it.Belleville's Salvaging the Real Florida is a series of. . .do we call them essays? Narratives is more correct. Written mostly first person present, his prose is elevated imagery, subtle metaphor from a suitor's pen; he writes with an earnest clarity and a near obsession of place. His real Florida is as grand as a first magnitude spring, but it's also close at hand, like the backyard woods you played in as a kid. His narrative pieces are siren song, but note . . Belleville's temptress could as easily be a murky swamp as a crystal blue spring or saltwater cavern.For those who love the natural Florida, or those who wish they did, there are simply no better books than these two from writer/naturalist Bill Belleville. Mind you though, after reading them, Belleville's obsession with place may become your own.--David Lambert, Southerner's Journal, 2011"

The Slashdot review appeared as I was half-way through the book and it didn't connect. May be it's me, but what I was reading in this book was quite interesting. First of all, this book takes quite an interesting approach to describe the problems in high tech community. It is very readable. The author covers *a lot* of stuff in 230 pages. I do agree with Slashdot reviewer that the author has only described his personal experiences. I've been in the field of IT for over 20 years and I think this is the first time a book talks so much about the people and their mindsets, without trying to offer a new buzzword. Refreshing. Of late I've been dealing with a lot of Indian offshore executives and I highly recommend that high tech companies (may be all companies) in India read this book so that they know how a mature professional ought to think. Part Three of the book is a classic introduction to the real product marketing, just the way it ought to be done in high tech companies. The context framework the author uses repeatedly is quite intriguing, although it just might come across as a little too-rigorous for a professional book like this."

One thing is preventing this book, and others like it from really spreading enough thru male idiology as to create the tipping point we need. The book is loaded with Christian references, when Dr Miles clarity and common sense is more than enough to bring the points home. Most christians out there are even tired of everything being related to this vague seemingly lovable character.....far, far away.....yet again! And what about Jews, Hindus,Muslims and people of the 101 other faiths. Does this book then mean that it is not really for them? See, once you have black there has to be white, its opposite.

I thought it would be very informative about one family's journey through unthinkable tragedy, and it was. I simply had absolutely no idea how far-reaching the effects of a violent crime reach. Each one of us should want to learn what happens to crime victims and how ""post traumatic stress disorder"" are inevitable and quite widespread. We should increase our awareness and sensitivity to these very deserving people. Mr. Cress's book helps the reader to understand this often disabling disorder. Moreover, this informative book highlights how victims have very few rights, while criminals are treated all too fairly. Knowing this will change my perspective forever. I appreciated the candid nature of this book, which made it difficult to read, but absolutely imperative for my limited understanding. I admire Mr. Cress and his ability to present the facts and his absolute honesty. Most of all I so appreciate the title, because the author himself has given me hope and the permission to smile. He reminds each of us that we have the choice always to move forward and the incredible privilege to smile...no matter what. I will never view my life the same, nor will I take it for granted. My thanks and admiration to a fine author and human being, Dick Cress."

However, I have heard so much about how brilliant his work was and anticipated to leaf through his very first novel (I would call it a novella). After reading Huxley's allegedly first novel, ""Crome Yellow,"" I couldn't help but be surprised by all the hypes about the writer. The beginning and ending of the story seems to be interesting enough which sets the reader's imagination to impetus. Between the beginning with Denis' arrival at Crome riding bicycle and the ending with Denis leaving the place thinking morbid thinking, there's only a twilight zone of inactivities - thoughts, ideas, philosophical discussions, a story within a story, and a faint hint of mis-directed affection and romance that is never to come to pass in the story. The twilight zone is fraught with social satires -- satirical comments. All these supposedly artists at the mansion tinkling with words - ah, words - and milling about their own carnivalesqueness of words, are nothing but the prop that the author wanted to use to deliver his social critique. Clearly, Huxley seemed to have fun experimenting his very first dallying with writing through this novella. ""Crome Yellow"" can never exceed any work by Oscar Wilde not to mention Charles Dickens. Just a poor imitation of an aspiring writer!"

He sets the record straight by tracking down and exposing the fabricated claims made by often quoted environmental groups.

The Cuckoo's Egg was an engaging thriller that appealed to even non-technical readers. Spam Kings started out by outlining nine key players, spammers and spam fighters, in the war to control email.The book does engage for the first chapters as it provides the back story for the two central characters, Shiksaa, the spam-fighter, and Davis Hawke, the spammer. Then as the author takes you through several investigations and prosecution the repetitive form becomes clear. The book ends on a low note as Shiksaa leaves spam fighting, Davis Hawke remains at large, and spam is worse than ever, making up 60% of all emails.This redundant consistency is a departure away from the formula of an engaging thriller. The formula that the Cuckoo's Egg followed very successfully. This departure is not a good thing, the book is a bit of a slog to get through and resolves somewhat disappointingly.In addition I often found it difficult to follow conversations between characters. The problem was two-fold in that many of the characters weren't well developed, and both spammer and anti-spammer often spoke with the same abrasive and abusive tone.There is an epilogue that covers the development of the characters into the present. I would have appreciated some information on this section about new developments in spam and spam-fighting.The book is reasonably well written and would likely be of interest to anyone deeply involved in spam fighting. For those looking for a good technical thriller you will want to look elsewhere."

Several versions ago someone realized that niche books for Exchange were feasible and we saw excellent volumes about just the IMC for instance. Exchange 2000 is like AD and deserves separate volumes for specific areas. It's too bad that a book like this has to be cluttered with migration information about systems that we have almost forgotten. Other chapters, like OWA, are a little light and could use more depth. And you have to wonder how many hard-core administrators will value the Outlook client chapter or Digital Dashboards.That's it for criticism. Browsing this book among others convinced me that it had the best balance for answering administrative questions. Sure the Admin Companion and Pocket Consultant fit into a full time Exchange consultant's library, but this book was the perfect balance if you cannot justify several. Tony Redmond's book will probably come along and knock our socks off, but for now this is the best balance of material on Exchange 2000 for the money.The Tuning and Troubleshooting chapters actually refer to the right tools unlike the Black book. (Even though the reviewers creamed it they did not mention enough of the inaccuracies.) SMTP configuration and NNTP are covered well. Security is tackled twice, with a chapter based on AD and then another with Internet considerations.Having been through the betas and release candidates hunting for information on each new release I found it refreshing to pick up SEU E2K Server and find answers to so many questions.

Thus, the puzzle: ""Why is competition failing in health care?""Porter and Teisberg's answer is that it focuses far too much on cost-reduction, increasing negotiating power, providing broad-lines of service, and cost-shifting, and instead should focus on long-term value (results vs. costs) for patients. Key to accomplishing this is the collection of standardized patient outcome data (preferably risk-adjusted) that are used to identify providers needing improvement and sources from which that improvement can be gleaned, as well as in guiding patient decision-making.""Redefining Health Care"" also asserts that its recommendations are not just theories, but also supported by a number of cited examples.This book provides a clear vision of how the U.S. can reduce health care costs while improving patient outcomes - without increased complexity.

It's a true credit to Mr. Allen's profession as an author that he's so willing to take on such a risk, while the well-known male authors of our time tend to only write about male characters.This book is a work of intense suspense, supreme fiction and gets in some remarkable looks at life.

Not only is it the story of how the Roman Republic was violently hammered into an empire, but Rubicon also gives very well written and enthusiastic background history as to how the Republic reached the point the point of no return.Civil wars and skullduggery of all types were rife in Italy prior to the coming of Julius Caesar, and his war against Pompey is only the most well known of the Roman civil wars...something I did not know prior to picking up Rubicon.Granted, Holland may inflect some modern perspective into ancient Roman events, but that did not bother me in the least. I felt his modern point of view was appropriate and did not unfairly color the events he was describing. Perhaps if a reader is searching for a more academic book, Rubicon is the wrong choice, as some reviewers have stated.

1557424470,The Picture of Dorian Gray,18.96,A32IS5PE0X6CJ1,J. Kendall,,3,1185753600,Not all that I expected...,"This novel is one which everyone has heard of and many are compelled to read it as part of school curriculum. I never did, but thought I would give it a try as I really enjoy dry British wit and intelligent prose. Beyond that, I wasn't sure what else I was expecting, but for my tastes, I didn't end up entirely satisfied.The opening 10 or 20 pages insinuated themselves into my imagination and I felt that I would be entertained by the main characters throughout the rest of the novel. The detailed descriptions of the lovely country setting and extravagant flowers gives one an impression of decadence and a high society jadedness that I somehow expected from Oscar Wilde, having read none of his previous work. Unfortunately, the remainder of the novel didn't hold as much pleasure for me.Dorian Grey is a relatively uninteresting central character who is but a blank canvas for Lord Henry to experiment upon; Dorian's own thoughts and musings are not so compelling in and of themselves and yet we are treated to quite a few pages of them throughout. Lord Henry himself is an interesting character whose mean-spiritedness, which approaches evil in some instances, is obscured by his verbose bantering on half-baked, jaundiced observations on Victorian life. These also consume considerable paper stock, and as witty as his musings start out (his thoughts on marriage were particularly humorous to me), they start to run together and become somewhat of a misshapen lump through which I felt I was slogging at times.Anyway, the story is relatively well known to most at this point, regardless of whether you have read the book in question or not. It progresses more or less as one might assume, which is not entirely a bad thing (I would not classify this tale as a mystery or as a horror novel, a genre to which I see it is sometimes curiously attributed). Oscar Wilde is definitely saying something here, and there seem to be many elements of allegory contained within the story. I have read that he saw parts of himself within all three of the main characters, and they do seem to represent different facets of a single personality. Unfortunately these same characters are hamstrung by this very fact, as they each seem only part of a personality, part of a character, and not well rounded or believable in their motivations or actions.This is the first Oscar Wilde I have attempted to read, and I won't say it is my last, but there are classics of English literature which are as well written, more engrossing, and, in the end, more memorable, at least to this reader (""Silas Marner"" comes to mind as a fine book I only just recently read for the first time as well).So, overall, about 3 stars from me. In my opinion it poses some interesting questions, sparkles in a few spots, and held my attention for a few hours, but it's not something I would return to or recommend for pleasurable reading.As a side note, I am somewhat surprised by the criticisms of the homoerotic nature of the relationships portrayed within the novel. Wilde portrayed the passionate nature of what amounts to a love triangle in a very effective (if slightly florid) way, and, as has been noted before, the relationships between the men seem more genuine and believable than those involving the fairer sex. Maybe this type of undertone would be out of place in a Hemingway novel but good grief it's Oscar Wilde! Scratch beneath the surface and read about where this man was coming from and the times in which he lived and worked."

At first glimpse, it's not constructed along the lines of an argument. That's because it is not, by Rolfe's own admission, an academic treatise. But after a good read, one finds that a consistent message does come through. And argument or not, it's a great book to curl up with because it gives readers a chance to revel in the past.As one of its most important themes, the book outlines several strains of the Bohemian movement as expressed in Los Angeles. Stressing that Bohemians came from a variety of political backgrounds, Rolfe nonetheless shows the radical strains informing their activities. He also laments that these days, there's not much going on that could be considered truly radical in LA literature, a loss he traces in part to the decline of the coffee house.Literary LA also gives a geographical tour of many of the sites around the city which feature connections to past literary greats. Who knew that Monrovia and Pasadena housed some of America's greatest writers, let alone a small house off an alley in Hollywood where Jack London MAY have slept?Maybe the best chapter is the one on Bukowski. Here Rolfe talks about spending time with the great poet, and here the book gets most gritty. And delicious.If you have an interest in LA literature (and if Rolfe is right, more American literature than you think is Los Angeles-connected) you need to buy this book."

Cats,"I have published plays and fiction, plus a few nonfiction items, but I have always wanted to be a successful screenwriter and have been struggling mightily toward that goal for five years or so. Like so many other would-be screenwriters, I've read books from the masters, and most of them were excellent books. However, I hadn't really yet come across a book that seemed to speak directly to me until I came across Save the Cat. Not only is the book packed with lots of useful, practical information, but it's written in a style that's a joy to read. Humorous, practical, and above all, useful. I know other reviewers have said this, but I wish I had had this book when I started screenwriting. Snyder covers everything from the logline to beats to practical ways to troubleshoot your script. One of the most helpful things to me was the glossary in the back. Every ""Hollywoodish"" term Snyder uses he gives a simple definition for in the glossary. For the first time, I believe I can actually understand the lingo. Some chapters that were especially helpful to me were chapter two, a discussion on genre; Chapter four, a section on structure; and Chapter six, common sense screenplay rules.These are just my favorite chapters; I found helpful information in every single one -- no exaggeration. In discussing genre, Snyder doesn't just use the basic ones like romance or science fiction. Read ""The Monster in the House"" to see just one example of a genre. He also writes on such topics as ""The Pope in the Pool."" I could go into a lot more of the book, but you can't get the benefit of it unless you read it yourself. I have had consultations, I have had coverage, and I have even taken one of the best online screenwriting courses out there, but I could have bought this book and saved myself a lot of money -- not that the other experiences weren't good ones because they were. This book just brings all you need to know right in one spot. I am going to be ordering the sequel to this one right away. By the way, Snyder gives you his email in the book, and yes, he did answer me when I dropped him a note. I don't know if that would mean anything to you, but it meant a lot to me."

Have customers; collect receivables; remit payables; weather disasters; out-maneuver competitors and not unimportantly; report profits.Donald Mitchell and Carol Coles, two Massachusetts-based business consultants, in their third book, challenge managers to recognize that business model obsolescence is the major unperceived opportunity for and at the same time threat to their enterprises. By simply adding these five foundational principles to the list, they can become ""all they can be"":1. Serve more people with what is perceived as improved performance, more rapidly and in more ways with fewer resources.2. Make each thought and activity apply to people and their purposes that are not now being served.3. Involve more people when considering each thought and activity.4. Begin each morning with the thought you are starting a new company.5. Strengthen your stakeholders' commitment to these principles.There can be little doubt that if more managers attached each day armed with these principles, their companies, customers and everyone they contacted would experience improved lives."

I've come across many pie books over the course of my baking career (at home, mind you) and I've yet to find one that measures up. While there aren't many pictures, they aren't necessary. The author gives instruction in explicit detail, and the facts and variations present throughout the book are just as informative. I've tried quite a few from each chapter, and each have come out wonderfully. Requests for the key lime come in annually, and the White Chocolate Ice Box Pie is just as popular (and AMAZING.) The bourbon apple is also a fave. One of the really great things about the variations of the apple pie recipes he has listed is that, with some, he modifies the top crusts (adding caramel, for instance) so that you learn not just the pie recipe itself, but the ways in which you can also modify the top; these 'top variations' are, in my experience, fairly interchangable with the other apple pie recipes he has listed. The types of crusts you can make have a chapter of their own, and are nothing short of awesome. I will never pick up a store-bought graham cracker or oreo crust again. And I love that he tells you what products work best for baking the pie, and WHY (Glass dish vs. Aluminum, for instance). Did I mention how much I love this book?"

B000FQ4J60,Psychology For Dummies (For Dummies (Psychology & Self Help)),3.99,A2WETFLJM0D6R0,"ewomack ""ewomack""",1,4,1246665600,Psych 101 refresh... without the enormous classroom...,"Anyone who has endured the quintessential coliseum-sized university Psych 101 class and recalls more than half of its contents does not need to read this book. But newcomers to psychology and those needing a cleansing refresh will obtain a decent high-level understanding of the basics. For those in that latter category, ignore the self-deprecating and unnecessary subtitle ""for dummies"" and tread onwards. This book, thicker than it appears, will guide the uninitiated (or re-initiated) through intimidating hedgerows of concepts, terminology, and history. At times it's even fun, believe it or not. Each of its eight parts deals with a particular psychological theme. These parts cover everything from the brain as the foundation of mind to personality development, abnormal psychology, Freud and Jung, engaging in therapy, types of therapy, even movie recommendations. Given the girth of material covered, each topic receives a decent skimming rather than a detailed plunge. But those wanting such an overview should start here. If nothing else, this book should help readers determine if psychology indeed rings their Pavlovian bells (see chapter eight if you don't know that reference).A basic theme throughout involves the ""biopsychosocial"" model. This model states that we're all products of our biology, our psychologies, and our societies and cultures. All contribute to our sense of self and others. The sections on biology delve into that elusive skull-encased wet mass known as the brain. Cool words such as ""corpus callosum"" and ""basal ganglia"" receive adequate explanation. Another section describes how our nervous system converts light, sound, mechanical and chemical energy into electrochemical energy that our brain can process. In essence, we interact with the world via transduction of various energy forms. Things start getting emotional when the book moves into psychological aspects, the book delves into Maslow's famous hierarchy of needs, optimal level of arousal theory, and opponent process theory. There's also a very touchy-feely discussion on the different types of love. Of course Freud appears. No survey of psychology can exist without him Though he remains controversial, his ideas of the subconscious, Id, Ego, and Superego still hold influence. A scintillatingly titled section ""to poop or not to poop"" delineates one of Freud's more messy developmental stages. Finally, our social aspects get covered in sections on social psychology, which include discussions of conformity, persuasion, and empathy. Other sections explore: chromosomes (X or Y?), what's ""normal,"" schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, forensic psychology, and psychological testing (MMPI, etc.). Later, the book covers the different types of therapies in some detail, such as psychotherapy, cognitive, client-centered, and existential. Ultimately, these sections seem to favor an approach that doesn't categorize people into discrete theories or approaches. The sway seems more towards client-centered and existential therapies. Two final sections contain top ten lists. The first, ""Ten Tips for Maintaining Psychological Health,"" introduces ""positive psychology,"" a new emphasis on what's ""right"" rather than what's ""wrong."" The final section lists ""Ten Great Psychological Movies."" Some great movies appear, such as ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" ""A Clockwork Orange"" and ""Psycho."" Many disturbing cinematic experiences await!Though ""Psychology for Dummies"" provides a good overview of its subject matter for beginners, the book contains one very annoying feature: its lack of a bibliography. References to studies, books, and articles pepper the text, but they go no further than ""Eron, 1987"" or ""Rushton et al, 1986."" Usually a bibliography at the end of the book fills in the attribution, but readers will search in vain for such a thing here. This turns what could be a simple lookup into a research project. Hopefully a future edition will address this problem. Nonetheless, this won't keep readers from stuffing their skulls with the basics of psychology. If you haven't started yet, start here."

He offers his keen scholarly insight into the mythic and sociological undercurrents of this still-evolving trend, which I found to be fresh and original. While one will inevitably disagree with some of his assessments (""The Matrix"" as garbage?), that's actually some of the fun--and value--of works like this, since it forces one to formulate one's own views in response more clearly, and stimulate one's thinking in ways that straight consensus wouldn't.There are a few notable omissions from his overview---horror films and experimental cinema surely deserve an seat at this visionary table--but then, a work covering every conceivable facet of this subject would have required a series of volumes rather than just one, so that may actually be a blessing in disguise. All in all, an important work on the premier art of our time--cinema."

Basically, she asks him to marry her because she believes he's poor and its a great way to get the man she loves to marry her without saying she loves him. He doesn't really need the money, but agrees and soon realizes he loves her. They spend the whole book (when they weren't having sex or planning to have sex or thinking about the next time they would have sex or the last time they had sex) thinking about how to get the other to love them without admitting their own feelings.Also missing from this story was the Cynster characters. I was hoping to get more of the characters from the earlier part of the series, but only got very brief snatches here and there.I was so incredibly irritated. Ms. Laurens did, however, get pretty imaginative with the sex, though. She obviously spent most of her time writing developing sex scenes.Not worth the read.

I don't necessarily agree with everything that has been said in those books, but this one is different. The primary focus this time around is organized religion. This is a must-read for people of ALL backgrounds, and to me, the premise (that these words are coming more or less directly from ""God"") is basically irrelevant. The message, however, is everything. Every message or truth in the world of relativity and perception must always come through a human filter. Because of this, the details and format of these messages will vary, but the Truth remains timeless and unchanged, and that's what this book represents. As an honest, informal critique of religous, spiritual, and sociopolitical issues, it's logical, practical, and catchy all at the same time w/less punning and play on words than in previous books of the series. While it is characteristically repetitive and Walsch clearly brings up issues that he doesn't side with in order to provide a more well-rounded argument, this helps to drive the point home, which is to say that our collective, worldwide society should examine and question its religious beliefs and values more carefully and modify or discard some of these old beliefs because they're simply not working. This book presents a challenge to its readers; it calls for a paradigm shift in not only how we think of God but how we think of religion in general. Personally, I couldn't agree more.It is also appropriately preceeded by a quote from one of the greatest (and my favorite) transcendentalist thinkers of our time, Emerson, but don't let the obvious New Age categorization deceive you. The ideas in this book are truly worth considering."

The author was given access to private writings of the family members, who were avid correspondents with one another. As a result, he is able to bring insight and additional historical information into the narrative of this famous financial house -- or rather houses -- as there were five established during the period of the family's greatest fame and influence. The author makes a strong case that financial constraints definitely limited the actions of nations as they sought to finance their wars and reparations when they lost.While the two volume work has great sweep, it lacks depth. One senses that since the Rothschild heirs gave the author access to previously unseen source materials, he was reluctant to level serious criticism against the family. Remember, in many cases the financing they provided governments was the necessary, but not sufficient, ingredient for great human suffering -- the very point of these volumes. It is not all a dark picture for the family's activities, far from it, but a blind eye has been turned. More importantly, one turns away from the effort of reading these volumes feeling unfulfilled. Of all that he has written, what was the significance of this great family's prodigious financial activity? Were they a force for good or evil? On balance, has humanity benefitted or been ill served by them? These questions linger as the second volume concludes, and they remain unanswered, or at least, without an answer from this obviously talented and hard working author.An essential, if unsatisfying, work."

Carson has done an excellent job exegeting 1 Corinthians in The Cross and Christian Ministry. He has also addressed many false, or just slightly off-base doctrines with it as well. It is not an exceptionally hard read, though I would certainly not suggest this to a new Christian, mainly because there is an assumption of basic biblical doctrinal exposure. This might be more confusing than it's worth to someone who hasn't done a minimal amount of doctrinal and scriptural study.Overall, he draws out several incredible points and definitely opens one's eyes to the many situations Paul was dealing with, as well as the overall context of what was going on in the Corinthian church that Paul was addressing when he wrote 1 Corinthians.Of course, if you do not hold to Pauline authorship or any acknowledgement of the authority of Scripture, I wouldn't recommend this book to you (see the second chapter). But if you are involved in Christian ministry at any level, this book will greatly contribute to your doctrinal and theological development as a leader."

Not a single clich&eacute; was left on the shelf, and no panegyric was deemed to extravagant to those who praised the Oslo accords to the skies. One exception was the late Edward Said who was highly critical from the outset. But then he, unlike the myriads of bumptious reporters and clich&eacute;-mongering commentators who ritually slobbered over it, had actually read the Oslo accords. It was clear to Said, and other Palestinians, that the accords were one sided, and essentially ""a cold and ungenerous peace"" dictated in Israeli interests. A year later as the Palestinians economy, territorial integrity and security had visibly deteriorated Said had this to say:""In what world do Yasir Arafat and Abu Mazen live when all last year [1993-94] they kept proclaiming their trust and confidence in Israel, an Israel that has dispossessed our people, and continues to this minute to confiscate land, to increase settlements, kill and incarcerate thousands of Palestinians?""In this collection of articles written throughout the period of 1993-95, Edward Said comments on the ""peace"" process as it developed, and the implications for the Palestinian and Israeli peoples. His views were criticised by those who supported Oslo as destructively negative, but it is hard not to consider his comments, such as the following, as essentially correct: ""There is no vision in the Israeli leadership, no sense that in the long run problems solved at Palestinian expense now will simply come back to plague both peoples in the future.""In addition to the central focus on the ""peace"" process Said finds space for a number of short biographical pieces, such as the one he writes about the remarkable Sara Roy (seeFailing Peace: Gaza and the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict), an American Jew whose family had suffered losses during the Nazi Holocaust, though this did not stop her from having the breadth of humanity to write eloquently on the form of apartheid and de-development that the Israelis subjected Gaza too. A lesser known figure is also remembered, Hanna Mikhail, a Palestinian Christian of Quaker extraction, who left behind a successful academic career in the United States to play a principled and exemplary role in the Palestinian Liberation Movement, and died in 1976. One of the highlights is Saids essay ""Decolonising the Mind"" in which he underlines the limitations of those rejectionists and sycophants of Israel and the West amongst the Arabs, and calls on the Arab world to engage in a comprehensive, nuanced and critical study of Israel and the West.Apparent throughout is the growing contempt that Said feels for how Arafat and his cronies conducted themselves. His thesis is that Arafat, fresh from his disastrous Gulf War diplomacy and short on funds from the Gulf States, undermined the Palestinian negotiators from the occupied territories by conducting secret talks with the Israelis in Oslo, essentially to save his own position. The accord Arafat and Abu Mazen (now his successor) negotiated was essentially a declaration of surrender as far as Palestinian interests were concerned. Everything for Israel, and at best vague statements for the Palestinians on crucial issues such as illegal settlements, refugees, economic development, institutions, and territory - the only concrete ""reward"" was Jericho and the un-settled parts of the Gaza strip that Yitzak ""break their bones"" Rabin (known as ""Soldier of Peace"" in respectable circles) had once hoped would sink into the sea. Functionally, vis-&agrave;-vis the Israelis Arafat was acting in the manner of a collaborator, and so it went on until the utterly paltry Israeli offer in the final settlement negotiations when he had no choice but to finally face reality, and refused to sign the final surrender.If you want to avoid mouthing clich&eacute;s about the 1990's peace process, and wish to have some crucial background for an understanding of current Israeli-Palestinian relations then this book is enormously important. Edward Saids critical intelligence, principled outlook and, in the best sense of the word, his critical voice are always worth listening to, and this book is no exception. It is a great crime that the Palestinian and Israeli leaderships did not take on board his calls for a just peace of equals."

080700443X,Do Americans Shop Too Much? (New Democracy Forum),13.47,A2BA8K77Z906T3,Melissa Hayes,,3,1045526400,Americans do shop too much...but they like it!,"I think that most people would answer the question of do Americans shop too much with a simple ""yes."" And the truth of the matter is that Americans would all shop even more if there were more money in the old wallet. I enjoy shopping myself, and thought that the book on the topic by Juliet Schor would make an interesting read.For the most part, I agree with Ms. Schor's arguments. Her idea that Americans are strongly motivated to acquire things in order to keep up with those around them seems to make sense. I do think, however, that most people who buy things for this reason are not totally aware of this as a motivating factor. It is just normal to want to be up to par with those considered to be at your own level or even slightly above.Schor also makes a good point in saying that consumers are not totally rational and are definitely subject to impulsive purchasing behavior. There is a reason why candy is located at the checkout line. Storeowners know where to put things in order to create a better chance of selling an item that isn't a necessity. Milk, eggs, and bread are usually located in the farthest department from the entrance of the grocery store. Of course, this is because store operators hope that the consumer will have other items catch his/her eye while on the way towards one of those commonly purchased items. We buy things that we were not planning on buying, and if anyone thinks otherwise, they are crazy.When reading Schor's seven basic elements on the politics of consumption, I couldn't help but think that she is in a dream world. Americans are never going to only purchase things that they ""need."" And if you were to ask someone if they really needed to buy shoes they would say yes, even if those shoes were a $150 pair of Nike basketball shoes. The line between needs and wants is blurred and will always be that way. Her arguments in this section are far too idealistic. There is no way that the American government would only tax high-end ""status"" versions of products and leave low-end models tax free. Government officials most likely only buy the high-end stuff to begin with, and you can't tax someone's taste. Schor's ideas sound lovely, but just aren't realistic to the majority of Americans. It would be wonderful to think only of quality of life rather that quality of stuff, but too many people think that stuff can make their life better.As far as the rest of the book is concerned, I enjoyed reading the thoughts of the critics of Schor's essay. It is hard to say exactly which point of view I can say I totally agree with. I guess there isn't just one. For the most part, Schor was right on in her thoughts. It is just too bad that we live in a society where most people don't even bother to think about what and why they shop."

I am a junior in college and can honestly say that I look better now than I ever did in high school.

I have already read it but keep it in my gym back for references and refreshers when my motivation starts to slack.I read through several of the reviews, and the negative ones seemed to all be saying that the lifestyle changes in this book are ""entirely too unrealistic"" or something comparable. I disagree wholeheartedly, but will say that this book is meant for people who want to attain bodies that SEEM unattainable (titled ""skinny chicks"" for a reason...) and yet, are not. It isn't a book to turn to if this is your first attempt at lifestyle change after an entire existence spent on the sofa eating buffalo wings.

0140122060,Paris Trout (Contemporary American Fiction),11.29,A3SI6F1RGCTAOH,Jonathan Carr,0.5,3,1182297600,An Almost Good Book,"The title character of this novel, Paris Trout, is an insane loan shark who keeps all the numbers in his head and his money hidden. He murders a fourteen year-old black girl. The structure of the book is such that the perspective shifts, we see the murder and its aftermath from the POV of Paris Trout, his lawyer, his wife, and several other characters. The social and historical world of the small Southern town in the late 1960s (just a guess, I don't know that the date is ever actually given) is credibly drawn. The characters are complex and interesting. There is tension and some exploration of grand ideas. But in the end, the book comes up short.The main points of softness in the novel (I would not go so far as to say it is a failure, the novel does work) surround the issue of motivation. The central action of the novel--the murder of Rosie Sayers--and the lesser actions of the novel--Paris Trout's spousal abuse, the condition of their marriage, the lawyer's handling of the murder case--do not seem to be entirely justified.We never really find out why Paris murders Rosie. Although reasons are given, they all seem to rest on the idea that he is nuts. And in the end, his insanity does not seem like enough of a justification. And at times, his insanity is even negated by his observations. At one point, while explaining to his assistant how to ""handle"" the Blacks from the community who come to borrow money, he says ""they're not different than you and me, that's the secrete."" This statement seems to undermine much of his initial motivation for murder.At other times, Trout demonstrates such calculated and reasoned actions that I often forget that there is anything wrong with him. The narrative reminds us that he is nuts by revisiting the floor of his room which has been covered with glass or it brings us back to some other similar artifact of his insanity.I could also never figure out why Hanna married Paris. The book attempts to explain it through the pressures of social custom, the desire for companionship, the idea that people change and are apt to never show their true selves during courtship. But in the end, Hanna is such an intelligent, strong, and perceptive character, a character that does not demonstrate weakness; that I find it difficult to believe she would be married to Paris.Dexter covers all his bases. There are no great failures in the novel. But the characters seem better suited to some smaller action. Their motivations, relationships, and eccentricities are never quite at home with the sodomy and murder that give the novel its shape."

Under the influence of Lord Henry, whose philosophy rest entirely upon self gratification that looks upon those good in life as those who are too weak and timid to live life, Dorian Gray trades his youthful innocence for a life of self pleasure at what ever cost.

0140178112,When Smart People Fail: Rebuilding Yourself for Success,17,A2FYK4HWXZRLPN,Gregory McMahan,1,5,1032048000,Required Reading for the Embattled Entrepreneur,"Failure among the ambitious, upwardly mobile, educated and intelligent of our modern, industrialized society often comes across as being more devastating, more defining, and more frightening than it actually is. What in actuality defines us is not the number of our failures, but how we deal with our failure, how we look upon it, and most importantly, how we either use our failure or allow our failures to define us.Hyatt and Gottlieb have written an excellent text on professional/career failure. The authors start the book by imparting intrepid examples both personal and private, of the emotional processes associated with failure. They accurately describe (often in painful and excruciating detail) the feelings of fear, isolation, shame and remorse associated with losing a job, status, money or some combination of the three. One can not only relate to the loss of purpose, the punctured egos, and the declining sense of self of those who have failed professionally, but also can actually feel as if it is happening to him or her- for it at some point has happened to him or her. They emphatically stress that career failure is something that eventually touches every professional, in some cases sooner, and in others, later. In this way, they show that failure has no prejudices, and everyone is a card-carrying member of this club, whether they realize it or not. As such, in dealing with failure, it is extremely important for the individual to realize that he or she is not alone in the experience, even if our greater society compels us to put up a strong front and pretend that nothing is really wrong. In order to healthily deal with failure, the authors emphasize the importance of understanding the meaning of failure in both the personal and the societal context, and elaborate upon how the feelings associated with failure unfold in the individual. Many people define themselves based on their occupation, their professional affiliation, or their status in life, and it comes as no surprise that these are the people hardest hit by career failure. Those of us who have cultivated other sides of our personality, such as those of us who live for our weekend hobbies, or those of us that are family or community oriented, tend to handle career failure much better, and can even take it in stride. Although many readers and those who have experienced failure or are currently experiencing failure may not believe it, failure actually gives people options, which the authors not only demonstrate, but also help the reader identify and ultimately take advantage of in later chapters.In the first part of the book, one chapter each is devoted to defining the characteristics of failure at the level of the individual and the society, dealing with the feelings, which occur in stages, associated with failure, how our career failures can affect those closest to us, and how men and women respond to career failure. The second part of the book focuses on taking failure in stride, and offers a comprehensive strategy for personal reinvention after suffering a career failure. Arguably the most important part of the book, this section devotes one comprehensive chapter to each of the following topics: discovering why one has failed, gleaning from the failure some positive knowledge by re-interpreting the events leading up to the failure, recognizing and casting off old and inappropriate labels and finding new ones, expanding one's career choices, and making the transition from the old professional to the new, centered and focused individual. The authors also include in this section of the book a bonus chapter that showcases two successfully reinvented individuals, and elaborates upon the nature of their failure, how they dealt with failure, and the process of their reinvention. Each chapter in the second part of the book provides the reader with powerful tactics to build a new, improved person from career failure, and allows one to rise triumphantly out of the ashes of failure, much like the proverbial phoenix. The third and final part of the book, entitled `Towards Real Success', helps the reader to win the internal battle associated with failure. While the second part of the book helps to outwardly reinvent the individual for career success, the final section of the book helps the individual to cultivate a new perspective, a new outlook- on career failure. This part of the book encourages the reader to look upon failure as a learning experience, and as such, helps one to regard failure as a temporary setback that one can learn from.The authors have written a truly empowering book, one that entrepreneurs and professionals must read and keep alongside all the other books on career and entrepreneurial success, as there inevitably will be one or more notable, spectacular and in some cases unfortunately public failures on the path to a successful career journey. In the end, I can only say that there is no shame in taking a risk, giving one's all, and failing, and I wholeheartedly believe that true shame results from failing to try, failing to risk, fearing change, and failing to grow. These, I truly believe, are the things that comprise the regrets in one's life."

For many decades after WW II, he was known as one of the leading chess theorists. For this set of books, there are:Volume 1: about piece plays and exchanges.Volume 2: about pawn structures and the center.Volume 3: about attacking on the wings, where one has superior position like pawn majority or weakness and subjected to a minority attack. (How Yin-Yang can chess be?)I found in a local library the first two volumes, and like them very much. For some time, I had a few chess books. In the openings, I have: Horowitz', Korn's and Fine's. For the endings, I have Fine's. I also have Tartakover's 500 master games. I could not find any GOOD books about theory in middle games. Then I got the books of Chernev (Most Instructive Chess Games...) and John Love's (Positional Ideas...). They teach about the middle games. Love's is good but not enough details, and I could not follow the logic (arrangement) of Chernev's. Finally I found this impressive work of Pachman. I know I must have Pachman's books in my collection. One day, I found at a local used chess bookstore these books. The curious thing was I here found only the last two volumes. I grasped them at once and knew that my collection was still incomplete. A few years ago, I found this compact version of Pachman. I got it, knowing that in this book the new editor dropped out lots of games. I agreed with other reviewers, Pachman took great care to select good games for his books. The new single volume book lost some of its value. It is still good enough to carry to a tournament as reference book, however to fully appreciate Pachman's effort, only the complete 3-volume set can do its justice. I plan to get the first volume to complete my collection, and the compact one is for reference.The arrangement of Pachman's work makes lots of sense. For tactical (easiest) chess, the piece play has the dominant roles as we see sub-1500 players often do. At the super-1800 level, the players begins to play positionally (more difficult), work with pawn structure and center more. After that, if both players are at higher level, they will work on the dynamic elements (most difficult): space superiority, square weakness, development lead, positional sacrifice, etc.Of course, this superficial opinion is from my only sub-1700 level, for sure the higher rank reader will think differently.This book was written in the pre-Fischer and Tal era, so the games didn't have much the dynamical aspects of the late 20th century chess. Even so, the theory and application of Pachman's work still find its characteristics in Nunn, Burgess, Karpov, Kasparov's chess and writings."

Writing in the first person as Quatermain, Haggard goes on to tell that one of the major reasons that this book is being written is because he needed to spend some time recovering from a leg injury sustained while shooting his (no kidding) 66th lion. Nevertheless he calls himself a timid man.The adventure starts when Quatermain meets Sir Henry Curtis and Captain John Good. Sir Henry's brother disappeared in Kukuanaland searching for King Solomon's mines. Off go the adventurers along the African Umbopa. They engage in an elephant hunt, nearly die of thirst in the desert, nearly freeze to death on the mountains, and nearly get killed in a massive civil war in Kukuanaland where 20,000 Africans die. After all of this they finally make it to King Solomon's mines which is guarded by pillars... stalagmites created by limestone and water dripping upon the corpses of kings of Kukuanaland. And then the evil old witch (doctor) Gagool seals them in. Don't worry. The story doesn't end there.If you're looking for the character played by Sharon Stone, ""there's not a petticoat in the whole history,"" says Quatermain. If you're looking for the Sean Connery character in ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,"" he isn't in this book other than by name.

Unfortunately, while it is interesting to read one person's perspective, this book doesn't provide any guidance or information that can help other parents handle similar situations without alienating their children, getting divorced, or feeling totally powerless against the medical community. The author, who researches and writes articles for a national news magazine, doesn't even mention--maybe he didn't take the time to do research regarding his children's disorders--that as a biologically-based mental illness, Bipolar Disorder receives the same level of insurance coverage as any other medical condition. That one piece of information alone could have helped him and other readers have an easier time finding appropriate treatment. If parents want to wallow in the disturbing experiences of other parents of mentally ill children, this is a good book. If they want a resource that can help them use appropriate parenting techniques for mentally ill children. take care of themselves and their marriages, and obtain successful treatment, there are other, better books.Sheryl Gurrentz, author""If Your Child is Bipolar: A Parent-to-Parent Guide to Living With and Loving a Bipolar Child""""The Guilt-Free Guide to Your New Life as a Mom"""

The key take-away not apparent to a casual reader of The Da Vinci Codes is that Brown is promoting a paganist agenda and did a lousy job of researching basic information. For example no modern scholar believes that 5 million women were executed by the church in order to destroy the myth of the feminine. Also taking the mythical document Q as a reference is ridiculous, no one has ever seen or read the thing. Probably Q does not exist, yet Brown makes it part of his science fiction story.Personally I dont think it matters if Christ had descendants. He would still be everything that he is in the Bible, with an extra dollop of humanity. Garlow and Jones remind us that there is zero evidence of Christ's legacy. Absolutely none, unless you take seriously writings of a crazed Frenchman who claims that he is the descendant of Christ.Garlow and Jones are very willing to criticize the church when that is called for, and over 2000 years, one needs to take the good with the bad. Cracking DaVinci's Code is an outstanding review of Christian history, beliefs, and teaching. The use of fictional characters in here having discussions on these topics does not work well, but still well-written and important book."

The last book wasn't great and this one is worse. I painfully read through the first 3/4 of the book, considering putting it down after each page. I even began skipping the monologues from the psycho's point of view.It wasn't until the last 20 or so pages that the characters began to be themselves and truly shine. Then I couldn't put the book down. Marino was once again the confident detective. Benton was the strong silent type. Scarpetta was the ever so intelligent Holmesian doctor.

What? Gars were created to battle mriswith? How convenient.Despite that it was an entertaining read as always. Richard continues in his heavy-handed, whiny manner that we have all come to love.

Number one, the title of the book is of the group that hails from Adie's home country that we learned of last book. They played a decidedly small part in the book. For carrying the title of the book, they weren't even the main plot line or a major antagonist in the book. they simply supplied the glue to keep some of the plot movements together.Secondly was the whole strange sequence of events with the Mriswith.

The South is familiar territory to this New Orleanian, who teaches at Louisiana State University. In ""What Gets Into Us,"" a story collection that also works as a fragmented novel with varying points of view, Crone depicts the tangled lives of Southern families -- the secrets of the neighbor next door, the waves of change that came with the civil rights movement and feminism and greedy development. Springing out into the world or slouching homeward, Crone's characters are as real as real can be.In ""The Ice Garden,"" winner of the Faulkner/Wisdom Prize, Crone tells a story of Claire McKenzie, one of the most engaging characters in this collection. Daughter of a troubled mother and a father in denial, Claire has more than her share of difficulties to face, but she does, and head-on, as is often the way with Crone's female characters.Crone knows the tangled ties of mothers and daughters: ""After a while I had the thought that my mother was very brave, compared to other people,"" Claire says. ""Because it was so hard for her to live, knowing all she knew, feeling all she felt, as disappointed as she was, as confused and jealous. My mother needed beauty to keep her going. There was just no other way for her. She could never get enough. I must be just like her, I thought, then I thought, no.""As with Ellen Gilchrist's beloved Traceleen, Crone's African-American domestic workers often provide the most telling perspectives. Sidney Byrd returns to town for her friend Pauline's funeral and has tea with a grown-up Lily Stark, whom Pauline once rescued from a terrible situation. ""At the sight of her serving me, I think, well, the time has finally come when Lily and I can talk as if there had been one life in that town in those days, and not two, the one at the front door and the one at the back. But soon I learn.""Crone has a gift for the telling phrase that conjures a time, a shared perception. Remember those parties, 'the kind where there was a huge dance band, white tablecloths, rum and Coke, and dinner""? Or the days when ""There were big state hospitals then, with nice grounds, which were peaceful, some of them -- people lived in such places for years, their whole adult lives. Families could take a person there and drop them off."" Or consider this description of a desperate woman: ""She is old now, but she can still throw herself at strangers."" Or ""Being a lady is all about ignoring things."" Entire eras, types of people, states of mind are summoned in Crone's gorgeous, memorable sentences.As time works on Fayton and exacts its inevitable toll on human life and spirit, Crone's families -- the Senders, the Starks, the McKenzies, the Cobbs -- experience loss and change, abuse and betrayal and sometimes redemption. The drug of place -- sometimes intoxicating, sometimes poisonous -- gets into the town's inhabitants with its changing architecture, its difficult, sometimes blinding, sometimes obscuring, light. Crone wholly imagines the lives of these people, who might be you or me, in the house next door in any Southern town, with all the lights on and everybody home, dark secrets in every corner.. . . . . . .Book editor Susan Larson can be reached at slarson@timespicayune.com or at (504) 826-3457."

He makes a strong case that the effects of music on society are more significant than even the ""conservative moralizers"" imagine."

I intended to write a review of every book I ordered through Amazon.com in the year 2002. Through no fault of Amazon, I found myself in the waning days of February with nothing to read. Of course, I desperately turned to Amazon and have ordered ""The Dancing Wu Li Masters"" which I am anxiously awaiting. In the meantime, my beloved wife said, ""you must read THIS book."" The book was ""Inconceivable"" by Ben Elton. She was right. I sucked up the 350+ pager in three days.Lucy, the female lead, desperately wants to have a baby and has been actively trying for five years (six if you count that year of living dangerously.) Sam, her husband, is a bit non-committal about, well just about everying. There is so much that is really great about this book, and the way the story is told is what makes so much of it great. Each page if filled with journal entries written by both characters. Journal entries which Lucy has ""suggested"" they do to explore their feelings about having a child and the posibility of infertility. Along the way we hear stories about procedures, sperm tests, and frantic mystical attempts to conceive. I have never had a book make me laugh so loud and so often. Not only are Elton's words beautifully crafted, he does an amazing job of making the reader fully believe in Sam and Lucy through absolutely brilliant characterization. Beyond the laughter, the growth that Sam, and Sam and Lucy's relationship develop has brought a tear to more than one person's eye. And guys, don't be afraid to read this one; you married bloaks especially will see many truth's. I'm sure the ladies feel the same way, but being a male, I'm certain they are wrong. :DTo my Britsh friends - You know Elton, he's funny as hell. If you haven't read it, get it and begin immediately. If you fear the recommendation of an awful American, know that my wife and I borrowed this book from an English couple who insisted it was a must read.To my American brothers and sisters - You will love this book more than the English do. We all know how much fun it is to watch them struggle in less than dignified situations. Two suggestions, don't take the criticisms Elton launches at Americans too seriously, they really do love us. Second - find a good web site to help out a little with the Britspeak. It's a good chance you don't know what snogging, the Tube, or bullocks are. It is worth the effort to ""get"" this book.That's right folks, it gets a five. And well deserved, after all, it does have have lots of gags about knobs."

Definitely worth the time it takes to read.,"Having just heard a report on the radio attributing the rise in the bald eagle population solely to the ""banning"" of the use of DDT, I know that reading ""Hoodwinked"" has broadened my perception of the ways in which we are fed half-truths on a daily basis and expected to accept them without question. Jack Cashill does a wonderful job in covering a wide variety of falsehoods spread primarily for self-serving reasons by those who stand to gain the most from them. Once these falshoods are passed into popular culture, they become known as ""fact"" and benign neglect begins to take hold.The book does loose one star from me for two reasons 1) I didn't think the timelines were clearly defined within individual chapters, which made the information in them slightly harder to follow, and 2) the title page for Chapter 5 (Sexual Fantasies) actually identifies it as Chapter 4 in the copy that I have, which introduces a moment of confusion if you're not aware of it ahead of time. :-)Having seen some of the more negative reviews of this book, I was anxious to get to Chapter 4 (Darwin's Heirs), which appeared to be the chapter that offended the most reviewers. Boy was I disappointed! No, not with Jack Cashill's writing, but frankly with the reviews. I realized later that there's so much factual information presented in this book that there were very few areas that could be attacked. Mr. Cashill makes it clear that illustrations of embryonic development drawn by Ernst Haeckel in the 1800s that were known to be false were still showing up in textbooks in the 1990s and that world renown biologists knew this and didn't raise a fuss about it because it served their purposes (p. 177). Some reviewers who had issues with Chapter 4 either didn't understand the point Mr. Cashill made, or didn't want to acknowledge it, but they unknowingly encouraged at least one person to actually read Hoodwinked to find out what the truth of the matter was.Parts of this book should be made required reading in public schools, but for a number of reasons (some of which should be covered by Jack Cashill in a ""Hoodwinked II"") I'm guessing that will never happen.Whether you buy Hoodwinked, or get it at the library, I'd encourage you to read it."

It begins as a ghost story, then near the end he does a twist on the movie &quot;The Three Faces of Eve,&quot; which is an adaption of a non-fiction book. It seems that he saved on writing time by reusing worn-out phrases that become tiresome by the conclusion.A paragraph filled with sad and glaring errors appears on Page 236 of the hard-bound edition. One of the supporting characters, Conroe, states that he did much browsing on the Internet and reviewed the medical records of Joan Hapgood. In addition, he checked birth certificates &quot;of every state in the East.&quot;Medical records are totally sealed, requiring the patient's permission before they may be shown to another doctor. Accessing that information on the Internet is impossible. Birth information is likewise sealed, requiring proof of the individual's identity before they may be released.Saul's depiction of his characters makes them to be wooden figures, with no individual identity.My sympathies to the young readers who never encounter the great writers such as Edgar Allan Poe, or Ray Bradbury."

Jerome and Markos have both blogged through the last several years as political junkies, showing their familiarity with this decade's crop of political players with every page. Familiarity has not led to contempt, as could so easily have happened given the recent lack of success for the progressive cause. Rather, familiarity has led to their deep concern for the future viability and success of modern progressive activism. Tying the future of progressive causes to the democratic party, they propose sweeping new commitments to grassroots activism to reap the rewards of new successes that are occurring at the local level. Their proposals are easy to follow and hold promise, although my own inclination is to not be so ready to dismiss the viability and capabilities of interest groups. Future editions of this work would benefit from more historical perspective on the growth of American progressivism. It's a quick strategic read and a riveting tale, capturing recent political events in what may be become the liturgy of the online progressive community. This book will almost certainly be a point of departure for more academic efforts at parsing recent political events, but its timeliness is simply alluring. Rock solid effort by these guys- which I suspect will quickly be turning heads on the Metro."

This is the third book, and I consider Chapman as the possible Ripper in the U.K. As for the U.S.A. it's a big stretch. However, not impossible, because as other books site, and newspaper articles, and police files Chapman was in fact in the New York area during at least part of this time..... It cannot be disproved like some suspects we know they were in prison at the time and so on. It is also a fact that around this time 'The Yard' sent an investigator from the U.K. to the U.S.A ......... The crimes are gone into great detail and here is the strong point of the book. Of course there is very little to connect Chapman to these murders in New York, and New Jersey. However, if you enjoyed his first book, and consider Chapman a Ripper Suspect...... I'd suggest for you to get this book..... You will enjoy. If your after a good solid case, I'm sorry the evidence just isn't enough to convict.."

Colorful, vibrant, textured verbiage make her worlds come to life. This world, set 200 years in the future, features humans having colonized and exploited two of our galaxy's spiral arms--thousands of worlds. Megacorps dominate all aspects of society-- but big business is corrupt.May ups the ante in this concluding volume of the Rampart Worlds Trilogy. The antagonist is now a xenophobic alien species secretly usurping our technology in a covert attempt to eventually overwhelm the human species and take over our worlds. They need &quot;breathing room&quot;.The tension in this one is certainly a bit higher than the other two books in the series-- the stakes are higher, and her protagonist, Asa Frost, is in dire straits when the book opens. Still, this wasn't a page turner like a Ludlum thriller. The twists and turns of this book were fun, tongue-in-cheek, goofy at times, with just a bit more seriousness than the first two. I must commend May-- I never tired of Asa Frost,although all three books are written from his perspective. Despite this, I still felt like her supporting characters were relatively undeveloped.What do I mean by relatively? Hey-- she still does a better job than 99% of sci-fi writers out there! May is a brilliant writer, with fresh ideas and perspectives that are a joy to read! By all means, read all her books, including this series, concluding with this finale, Sagittarius Whorl."

She also explained the general misconception that geishas sell the virginity. Overall, this book is englightening with regards to not only geishas but also the Japanese culture. The story is autobiographical and less dramatic than ""Memoirs"", which is fiction. Also, Iwasaki's writing style can be a tad monotonous at times.

The book was recommended to me by a family counselor. The only problem I had with the book was the authors' failure to acknowledge the glass ceiling that fathers still have with being involved with their children. The courts (at least in Washington County Minnesota) still regard the mother as the primary caretaker and influence in the childrens' lives. Although they don't always consciously acknowlege this, mothers often relegate the fathers to the status of being sperm banks and checkbooks. In this era of high seperation and divorce, many fathers see very little of their children and as a result, it is always the mother who has the greatest influence upon the childrens' lives and their view of men.

It's definitely not Mel Bay's book. I've been through the Mel Bay series many years ago and even after 30 years of not playing guitar, I can still play the first half of Senorita - Mel Bay's arrangement of an etude from Carcassi op.59 - his Complete Guitar Method in Three Parts.The Mel Bay version, that was in Grade 2 for probably 30 years, was a reasonably accurate arrangement, made a little simpler to fit a Grade 2 (as in guitar grades, not school grades) student. This book no longer has the Mel Bay version - it must, therefore, be the Bill Bay version. This version is boring, overly simplified, does nothing respectful to the master's work - or to Bill Bay's father's work.I had ordered the extended versions as I am re-learning to play guitar and had always been a huge fan and evangelist for Mel Bay books - in fact, even though I haven't been playing for many years until about 8 months ago, I have still bought many Mel Bay books as gifts for all my kids and grandkids or anyone else I knew that was learning guitar. When I found how badly the extended versions had mangled Mel Bay's original work and arrangements of other master works, I was pretty disappointed. Thinking that I would get the original books and use them as my base with the extended versions just used for the ""extended"" parts, I ordered this book, which was supposed to be the original. In fact, I used the ""Look Inside"" feature to find Senorita specifically and verify that it was the much better original version - since that was the only song I really remembered from 35 years ago. The ""Look Inside"" showed it to be the Mel Bay arrangement.Well, I got this book this week only to find that this book, supposedly the original, has received the same Bill Bay thrashing and now has the overly simplified, completely boring, version.Funny thing is that I haven't noticed such changes in Grade 1. Maybe I just don't remember as much about that book after all these years but the pieces I do remember seem to be untouched.Why Bill Bay felt he had to, or could, improve on his father's work is beyond me.I have to say that Grade 2, this version or the extended, are a complete disappointment compared to the real Mel Bay versions. If you can find an old copy of Mel Bay's Modern Guitar Method, buy that instead of Bill Bay's Modern Guitar Method."

In fact, I bought it because I already owned the sequel (Forever and the Night) and I hate to start in the middle of a storyline. I must say, I was a little disappointed by this one and hope the sequel is better.The book started with Kay Westmore, a late 30-something US National Park Service Ranger in Alaska, dealing with a bad breakup and a fledgling relationship with Stef, an early 20-something college co-ed. It seems Kay's estranged ex was stalking and threatening her, and that the co-ed was ready to start a relationship while Kay was not. This was the first few chapters.The next chapters (i.e., most of the book) were about Kay's assignment to provide a tour of the Alaskan pipeline to Grace Perry, an ambitious goverment official. Unbeknownst to Kay, Grace is investigating the malicious tampering of the pipeline. Grace is difficult, demanding, and obnoxious, but Kay stays true to herself and keeps Grace safe during an extreme snowstorm and cold spell.The romance was only a very minor portion of this book. From this reader's viewpoint, this was merely a mystery book with a lesbian as a main character. Even after reading the back cover, I wasn't prepared for that. I'm hoping the sequel will focus more on the relationship between Kay and Stef, and will be more in line with Young's other published titles."

Not only do the authors deal with the physical stuff but they also deal with the emotional side of the letting go. In addition to having some great cartoons, the book is written in a conversational tone and with a great deal of humor as exemplified by a chapter entitled ""The Secret Life of Clothing"".SCALING down is divided into five parts. In Part 1, the Challenges of Scaling Down, the authors discuss the nature of clutter including a quiz entitled ""How Stuffed Are You?"" They then present their approach, which is to develop with the client a simple mission statement that includes obstacles, as in ""I need (or want) to _________________ but _____________. They then present 21 obstacles, excuses and fears and provide suggestions on helping the client past each of them.In Part 2, ""The Culprits"", the authors deal with the major issues of paper, clothing, gifts and what they call the `tyranny' of collections'. A simple filing system is suggested for a more simple lifestyle. Judi & Marj discuss how to help a recent retiree pare down ""the physical evidence of a lifetime of work"" in a compassionate and respectful manner. Since guilt is usually associated with getting rid of items that were gifts from others, the authors present options for getting past the guilt. They analyze the `why' of collecting and suggest ways to lead the client to the `better' not `bigger' collection.Special Situations are dealt with in Part 3. The task of clearing out a family home covers numerous issues from family dynamics and old hurts to allowing enough time and getting items successfully distributed to their intended new homes. In the chapter called ""Your Cuisinart or Mine?"", the authors deal with blending households as well as separating households. As in other Parts, Marj and Judi deal not only with the physical stuff but also handling the emotional issues involved in these emotionally charged situations.Although the Part 4 Scaling Down Strategies, such as skimming and triage, are pretty familiar, they also discuss the psychology of shopping. Additionally there is a whole chapter dedicated to helping clients cull through their life's memorabilia and enable the client to keep only that which is truly significant to their lives. They also provide a list of 28 techniques to prevent the return of clutter.The final part of the book deals with the rewards of living in a smaller space and emphasizes the avoidance of the bigger is better mentality that surrounds us in today's culture. Their definition of what a home should be sums it up. ""Your own home...is a backdrop to help your life flow smoothly and provide comfort and self-expression---not be an end in itself."""

Hilterman""",,5,1267401600,WW II resistance in Belgium helps downed flyers,"Resistance refers to the civilians throughout Europe, in particular Belgium, who helped downed fliers disregarding their own safety and discovery by the Germans and others that were German sympathizers. These brave rescuers would hide these men in their homes, usually a hidden room in their homes or barns, get the usually needed medical help, feed and clothe them, and try to keep their ""roomers"" to themselves and a very few trusted that were part of the resistance network. Many allied pilots and crewmembers stayed alive only because of the actions of these brave souls.Many times other civilians were also hidden if they were Jewish or were hunted by the Germans for some other reason. This hiding was just as dangerous. If any of these anti-German residents were discovered, they usually faced immediate execution or a trip to a German prison or concentration camp. If the Germans knew of a hidden person and no one would turn them in, there would be retribution to those in the nearest town, usually killing ten citizens for every person known and still not discovered.Other times some of those, as in Resistance, fell in love with their saviors, many times not knowing if it was true love of just the fact that someone was there. Some of the husbands would have to leave their wife and home and disappear to do some more rescuing or move some along the line back to their own nation when that path seemed safe. In Resistance, Ted, an injured pilot rescued from the woods by a young boy, was taken eventually to Clair and Henri's home and hidden in an attic room. Ted needed medical help and received it from another resistance woman who snuck into their house to offer the aid. When Henri left, Ted and Clair found an attraction to each other that at first felt wrong but became near normal for them after Henri was gone for a few days. Forbidden love!The resistance force, as well as all that lived in German occupied nations such as Belgium, lived in very primitive situations where food was very scarce, animals they had on their farms were being taken by the Germans as they needed them, and any other basic living needs were almost non-existent. They lived a very hard brutal life. But the help they gave the allied soldiers meant so much to all those involved. This book goes into detail and allows the reader to suffer as all those brave resistance friends and the pilots and their crews that survived in various kinds of injured distress."

(188 pages)The second provides a complete structure of dzogpachenpo.Page: XVi: I HAVE TRIED TO AVOID ANY INSTRUCTION ON THE STAGES OF EXPERIENTIAL MEDITATION!!!(so why this title?) since one should get them individualy from a true master.Pages 189 to 406 of the second part are essentialy on the view of dzogchen, that is its metaphysics, but not on the practice as the lama said acurately!There is only one practice text by Longchen Rabjan: p 356-374 Instructions on the meditation... It is a sumary of the text Naturaly liberated mind (not given in the book). And the lama introduces it by saying: As it is very brief and compact, in many places it is hard to comprehend. So why did he choosed it?Furthermore the main part of the text is about the tantric preliminaries then 2 pages about the 4 yogas of dzogchen semde (presented in a full book elsewhere, see my review on Roaring silence), and only 2 criptic pages on dzogchen pith instructions, without notes nor explanations.There is an other text, close to practice pages 303- 315: an abriged translation of Twenty seven courses. 27 courses on dzogchen abriged in 12 pages!

To some religions, such as Judaism and Christianity, it is believed to be the sacred written word inspired by God through his ongoing presence and activity in history. Some people take these scriptures literally word for word and trust in them with complete faith. Others are open to and allow the word to be interpreted different ways accordingly. Some people believe the Bible to be nothing more than ""another elaborate story."" Whatever way you look at this issue, which has numerous positions, there is one certain thing that can be said of the Bible. It is a book. It may sound simple and obvious, but this statement is true, significant, and often overlooked. The Bible has had the single greatest impact on Earth than any other book yet many questions still remain unanswered.William M. Schniedewind's How the Bible Became a Book attempts to explain exactly what the title suggests. Schniedewind shows how the oral teachings of the Israelite culture were gradually replaced with a set of written texts. There were many reasons for this important transition, as Schniedewind explains each of these factors throughout the Bible's entire history. What many people fail to comprehend is that there are no definite black-and-white answers to the questions regarding the some of the most discussed problems concerning the Bible as a book. Schniedewind incorporates many archeological facts and photos and Bible quotes along with his own research and beliefs to show exactly how the Bible first started and developed throughout the long and broad history of writing.The way this book was written allowed for a much easier read than I anticipated. The introductory chapter and the paragraphs it contained were very similar to a thesis statement with three broad, yet clear, questions. Who wrote the Bible? When was it written? Why was it written? Each chapter is devoted to one distinct area of study which made the book seem a little less overwhelming once it was divided into segments. Schniedewind begins by painting a picture for the reader of the time when writing was very uncommon and seen as ""a gift of the gods"" (24). Therefore, only subjects of great importance or value were ever written down and only a select few were literate.As civilizations developed, power and economies became a vital part in of a thriving city or group. As the state of Israel developed, Scribes had the necessary means of writing down the oral traditions of their ancestors. Even though these scriptures were written down, they were still always proclaimed, mostly in the form of song, rather than read silently. In the late eighth century, the Assyrian Empire gave rise to the use of writing for administrative purposes. Urbanization took hold of the lifestyles of traditionally migratory people which allowed for the emergence of writing to the common people outside of the temple and palace. ""Alan Millard, a professor of Oriental Studies at the University of Liverpool, has noted that from the eight century onward there is a noticeable increase in graffiti on pots and tombs in Phoenicia"" (66). There was then a period of writing influenced mostly by King Hezekiah and his Scribes who wished to celebrate and interpret this rich history. From this period of the Scribes' writing, we see the start of Pentateuchal literature and the Book of Kings and the Book of Prophets.The Josianic Reform had a major impact which lasts to this day. This was period of cultural revolutions as writing became a defining force not only in politics and religion, but in society as a whole. Everyone was now expected to be literate and the written word became an authority by which no man could rise above. Old social structures and traditions were altered because of this new shift in power which only caused more problems for those unwilling to adapt from oral to written practices. The Torah is where we see a very crucial example of how stories told from mouth to ear generation after generation came to be written down in a set of five books. ""As Moshe Weinfeld has pointed out, `The transition from Torah as a specific instruction to the sacred `Book of the Torah' of the Josianic period marked a turning point in Israel's spiritual life"" (120). Before these ""teachings"" were written down, they were viewed as instructions and laws upheld by blessing and curses, but now it became put on a pedestal and were valued and regarded as sacred instead of feared during this time period.These writings continued well until the Israelites were exiled by the Babylonians. During this time period, Schniedewind believes that literary development slowed with the fact that there was no centralization in a society which had been forced back to their migratory roots. Schniedewind shows this with the dry lists of dates, chronologies, and objects. Once the Israelites return from exile, there is a new shift in the textualization of the scriptures. With a renewed sense of urbanization, the priests and scribes make it there mission to hold the most authority in the Jewish community by being the ones who produce their own written ""word of God"". This segment of writing between the Persian and Hellenistic Periods is a very ""dark"" time because there is little evidence outside the Bible itself for the circumstances in which the text was written during these years, which is why there are so many opposing theories about it. The use of Aramaic script overtook Old Hebrew, which would later be translated into Greek by Jews in Alexandria. Many new features are added to the use of written scripture including the storage of it in the Temple Library, a distinct pattern for reading the Torah, and guided instruction on using ""the word of YHWH"".It was very interesting to me that Schniedewind made the point that Jesus practiced his authority through oral teaching and practice over the use of written text. It makes perfect sense that Jesus used this because he was in an environment where the people he would reach out to and welcome couldn't read or write. Only people of high status including Pharisees and the wealthy were literate. Even in Jesus' verbal teachings, he pronounced and quoted the written word of God many times for this was the only way those around him would have experienced it.I feel that this book was very helpful in answering a lot of questions I'm sure many people, including myself, have had in the back of their minds for a long time, but were uncertain who to ask or if they should. This book helped me to realize the importance of the Bible in a different light. It's been a long time since I've sat down, looked at a Bible and thought, ""Wow."" I look at the Bible as something much more than any other book because of my faith. Therefore, I believe that not everyone who reads this book will have the same response or understanding as I did. ""When a text is central to a people or a nation, like the Declaration of Independence or the Constitution is, the history of its interpretation can serve as a window into the history of that people"" (5). I read this book differently because it's the history of my own personal beliefs. I respected the way Schniedewind objected to other scholars' previous claims and believes. He did so in a way where he displayed his own thoughts on a subject and then gave many credited examples for why he believes it.The written word allowed for the stories of the Old and New Testament to reach billions of people all over the world at much faster rate. It was hard for me set aside my Western thinking where a lot of things, including being able to hold a Bible in my hand and read it myself, for granted. I think the fact that the Bible is readily available in stores, libraries, and almost every hotel room across the nation has caused Americans to not place enough value on it. Having the opportunity to listen to scripture being read in ancient times was a privilege and if you were fortunate enough to read it yourself, you were truly blessed. Today, most people don't see this as a privilege anymore, and since we have the ability log onto [...], the Bible can reach people more easily than ever before but at the cost of surrendering value people place on it.I basically agree with almost everything Schniedewind proposes because it makes sense. At first, I was reading the three main questions and was wondering how he would be able to answer everything they cover in such a short book. He came through with an answer that was thoroughly supported. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who has ever wondered about how the Bible came to be. It took so much for this one book to become an everlasting presence of God throughout the rest of the world. I learned more about the Bible as a document than ever before from reading this book. I checked to see if there have already been books like this published and there were some, so I can't say that it is the foremost authority on the subject. This book has persuaded me to research the Bible a little more. It's something that I grew up with almost every single day of my life, and now I understand how that came to pass."

Tolbert,,5,1359936000,Not Another Guilt Trip,"Often women such as myself hit a circumstance in their marriages or lives where they feel something is broken. If you're like me you have many questions about your feelings of brokenness; why do you feel broken, are you actually broken, can you be fixed?I read many books written to women on many of these topics and the majority of them were toxic. The solutions were band aid. They were solutions full of passivity and passes for male behavior. The attitude of ""Woman, shut up and color"" filled these books. They might not have said it outright, but that message was still there, at times in the subtlest of ways. These books heaped on the guilt, added to the pressure, and simply increased the hopelessness.Not Captivating. Captivating was wonderful, liberating, filled with hope, and very down to earth. I wish I had come across this book first and long before I ever got ahold of other ""Christian"" books geared toward women.If you're broken and hurting this is a good book for you to read. Yes there is hope. There is reason for that hope. Yes you can be fixed. This book calls women to action and to realization, not to passivity and guilt like so many others."

In my opinion the woman speaks more clearly and I find it easier to hear and repeat after her lines, however having two speakers really helps when you're having trouble hearing exactly how they are pronuncing something. 2) There is sufficient repetition to really learn the material well.Things I don't like about the program: 1) There is absolutely no written material for the course. I understand that the purpose of the program is to teach you how to speak (and not read or write), but how difficult would it have been to include a 1-2 page transcript of the words and phrases that are being taught? They can say all they want about how ""that's not how you learn a language naturally...you do it by listening,""...fine, but I still want to know how the words look in writing. And why hinder the people who want to reinforce their learning through seeing it in print, when it would seem so easy to just throw in a cheap transcript and leave the options to the learner. 2) Although the amount of repetition is warranted, it gets a little frustrating when after an hour or so into the CDs you're still working on a few variations of a very few sentences. I don't really fault the program for this however, its just a difficult language to learn I think. I haven't tried others, so I can't make comparisons with other products, but overall I think it's a decent program at a pretty reasonable price."

1892389444,Viator,25,AKT8TGIT6VVZ5,John Kwok,1,5,1116460800,Slender novel is another great work by Shepard,"Lucius Shepard is yet another of science fiction's elegant stylists, and a founding member of its cyberpunk movement. Unfortunately he may be the least known, most underrated American writer of elegant fictional prose. ""Viator"" is an excellent meditation of madness and love as seen through the eyes of Thomas Wilander, who wonders whether he is losing his mind while living aboard the nearly derelict freightor Viator, now beached permanently in an Alaskan coastal forest. We are thrust into a surrealistic fantastical landscape that's most reminiscent of tales penned by Edgar Allen Poe and especially, H. P. Lovecraft. Wilander finds some solace and love in Arlene, a local resident. And yet, having found reality in the form of Arlene, Wilander still wonders whether the strange dreams he has nightly are visions of his future, and that of the beached freightor. He finally obtains the truth about the ship's enigmatic history from the vessel's mysterious absentee owner. But is this sufficient knowledge enough for Wilander to save his mind, soul, and his love for Arlene? Long-time admirers of Shepard's fiction, as well as those new to it, will enjoy greatly this fine little novel."

It is not that it is a bad book from a literary point of view - it is actually well written and it has some unique and interesting observations that make for good conversation starters and would be a good catalyst for starting a research project if you were so inclined, but it is not an objective rendition of history by any means.It is not that his description of historical events is inaccurate or false because they most assuredly are not. The trouble, from my point of view, is that the book is not really a history of the United States so much as it is a cultural critique of United States history from a modern academic elite, left-liberal, multicultural, class identity perspective (simply ""academic liberal"" in the rest of this review). Someone sympathetic to this academic liberal view of things will find it very persuasive, but it is not a balanced view of things from the perspective of the people living at the time. The whole realm of revisionist history on this basis is not only ideologically biased, which I fully recognize is true to some extent in all history books, but this one is deliberately biased to establish what is deemed to be a morally `superior' position from the academic liberal point of view. On this point I will quote Jacques Barzun from his book From Dawn to Decadence: 1500 to the present, 500 years of Western Cultural Life ""... I have not consulted current prejudices. ... every period stands justified in the sight of God, it deserves at least sympathy in the sight of man. ... It is waste of breath to point out that every observer is in some way biased. It does not follow that bias cannot be guarded against, that biases distort equally, or that controlled bias remains as bad as propaganda... One has then the duty to report the informed judgment of others."" [italic emphasis added by me] And elsewhere Barzun says ""Our age is so tolerant, so broad-minded and disinclined to violence in its ideologies, that to find a case made out for the temper of the 16th or 17th century is bound to affront the righteous [and I will add the 18th and 19th centuries]. Yet without exposure to this annoyance, one's understanding of our modern thoughts and virtues is incomplete.""The common method in this type of writing is to take indisputable historic facts for a particular time or event and use this as the framework to hang academic liberal ideology on; this makes it appear the writer is revealing a new truth of the time in question when in fact nothing could be further from the truth. Zinn's ""truth"" is only a subjective truth in his academic liberal view of the world. As he says of Columbus' description of America to the court of Madrid ""His descriptions [are] part fact, part fiction"" and I submit that the events presented by Professor Zinn are as well `part fact, part fiction'; his facts are no doubt accurate, but his description of the social and cultural conditions leading up to various factual events and the consequences resulting from the events are all seriously skewed or even fabricated to conform to Mr. Zinn's modern liberal academic view of things. In short, it is a very subjective ""history"" and not at all objective in any common understanding of the term.The problem I have with this type of revisionist ""history"" is that Western civilization, and America in particular, is always portrayed as a continuous chain of immoral colonialism, imperialism, and exploitation of ""minorities"" (including women) and the laboring `underclass', with little if any saving grace. Again, the conditions he describes are no doubt reasonably accurate, but his interpretation of their causes and effects are what is ideologically misleading, and from my point of view dishonest. It is not just Howard Zinn's book that has this flavor; most such texts of the last 30 or 40 years that receive high academic acclaim follow this same pattern.And further, I believe Howard Zinn's book is deliberately biased in a way specifically designed to denigrate, delegitimize, and undermine classic Western culture and civilization in subservience to any and all other cultures regardless of the fact (or more likely because of the fact) that classical Western culture and its political respect for individual rights and responsibilities has achieved the greatest personal freedom and productive society in the history of the world (and not incidentally given professors like Howard Zinn and other `intellectual' elites the freedom to preach their ideology). But academic ""intellectual"" elites, such as Howard Zinn, with their socialist mentality and ideology can not stand this fact; indeed, from their point of view it is not admitted to be a fact.What is missing from Mr. Zinn's narrative is Jacques Barzun's sense of appreciation for, and understanding of, the civilization and cultural norms of the times in question; everything in the past is judged and critiqued based on the modern academic liberal cultural viewpoint. As a counterpoint, Paul Johnson, in his parallel book A History of the American People, does not refrain from covering the brutality and mean spiritedness of events in history, but he portrays them in the context of penecontemporaneous cultural norms as unbiased by modern sensitivities as can reasonably be expected. Howard Zinn on the other hand deliberately portrays everything from a modern liberal cultural bias and he does this intentionally to denigrate and delegitimize opposing views of events more consistent with the mores of the times. (Incidentally, Paul Johnson's book is a close parallel to Howard Zinn's in both time and events covered but beyond that there is no similarity at all; Johnson's was copyrighted two years earlier, 1997 vs. 1999 - it is almost as if Zinn wrote his to counter Johnson from a modern liberal multicultural viewpoint to give university faculties a text with a ""politically correct"" version of the period from Columbus to now. If you look at the references in both books you will find very few overlap and all of Zinn's that I am familiar with are either ""politically correct"" academics or disenchanted writers from previous times - i.e. everything about America from the beginning is negative, nothing is positive or enlightening. Jacques Barzun's book also covers the same time period, but his book covers both Europe and the United States; his is copyrighted in 2000). From my point of view both Johnson and Barzun are far more reliable historiographers of the times and events in question.Starting with Columbus and his encounter with the Indians, then on to the general European conquest of the Americas and the colonization displacing the indigenous people, the conduct of the slave trade, the American Revolution (The Declaration of Independence and the Constitution are particularly vile documents in Zinn's view of things), the Civil War (his take on the motivation for and consequences of the civil war are particularly disingenuous), on to the industrialization of the nation, then World Wars I and II, and on through Korea and Vietnam, and ultimately the present everything is seen as a continuous chain of exploitation, oppression, and imperialist aggression of the under-classes and poor nations by the rich and powerful - no exceptions and no saving grace - it is all class warfare in a truly Marxist view of things. His book is filled with quotations from labor leaders, war resisters, fugitive slaves, disgruntled workers, and other discontents but nothing from the less disaffected members of society and many of his quotations are without context or perspective so it is impossible to tell whether the situation is a general condition or just a fringe anomaly. Zinn reduces every subject into a simplistic, two-dimensional (good, bad) reflection of his opinion - and he does a fairly good job of structuring everything to fit this opinion.But without even getting into the book we see on the cover a tip-off to its multicultural revisionist ""history"" slant; it states ""A People's History of the United States is the only volume to tell America's story from the point of view - and words of - America's women, factory workers, African Americans, Native Americans, working poor, and immigrant laborers,"" and I might add, paraphrasing Jacques Barzen again, ""with all the current prejudices."" It also states on the cover that Howard Zinn is ""a historian, playwright, and social activist"" and I will add that his history and plays are all consistent with his social activism. I have to concede here that at least this is honest advertising: if you subscribe to modern multicultural ideology you will like the book; otherwise you are duly warned to steer clear of it unless you are doing research to counter its destructive intent. And I do mean ""destructive intent."" The whole point of writing books like this is to indoctrinate students (and the general public that the author hopes will read the book) in the socialist, multiculturalist ideology (actually a primitive tribal community culture) with the intent that in due time the entire population will fall into line with the preferred ideology like sheep (sheeple?) and we will finally reach utopia - read George Orwell's Animal Farm and Aldus Huxley's Brave New World for a glimpse of what this world would be like (will be?) if people like Howard Zinn were to get their way.What people like Howard Zinn and his academic and other literati elite cohorts have in common is disdain for the Western tradition; they admit no moral virtue or insight of the human condition in classical Western culture. In contrast their evocation is to claim that the evils of imperialism, colonialism, oppression, and exploitation are now, and have always been the daily rituals of Western society. But if Zinn and like minded academics are correct that America (and Western cultural in general) is so evil, corrupt, and degenerate how is it that we are the freest and most prosperous nation in the history of the world (at least up to now)? Why do all the minorities and downtrodden of the world take great risks to come to the United States and not the other way round?"

The classes were somewhat useful and I was curious to read and learn more about it. I had recurring back and neck pain that was leading to early stage tendonitis as well for over four years. Before that time I was an avid runner, but all this had caused me to give up a lot of physical activity. After going over the exercises in the book, and doing the cat stretch regularly, my life has completely changed. My head is positioned much better over my neck and shoulders and my shoulder and neck pain has reduced by over 90%. The upper back pain is also mostly gone. Most importantly, the movements have helped me get in tune with my body, and if I sense that some muscles are sore, I have a battery of movements that I can leverage to fix it. The effect is truly amazing.The illustrations in the book are somewhat hard to follow, but one gets used to it. Most importantly, unlike other techniques, there is no ""one"" way to do the movements. One has to sense and find the movement yourself. In that sense, this technique is a lot different. This book is worth every penny you spend on it."

0553575171,Planet of Twilight (Star Wars),7.56,A1NTQWG6KZVJU3,"Justin, Texas",,1,1354665600,"Good science fiction, not good star wars.","Pre prequels era (literature wise) novelization that adds to the legacy of pre-empire jedi lore, which sadly gets cancelled out only 2 years later by the prequel story, and then the nail in this book's significance coffin gets hammered in by a later romance with mara-jade. I don't know if it is the realization that Disney will completely destroy any and all starwars novelization cannon, or if I am just getting too old for starwars, or if it continually feels like these novels matter less and less. I have yet to see anything in the starwars novel universe materialize into anything significant in the movies (besides the idea of a city planet called Coruscant), and now that Disney bought them, I bet everything in these books will become even less significant. I've been reading these books for 20 years, and I have been continually feeling like I'm in a universe that nobody but me cares about anymore.About the book: I just feel like it's boring. I have been having a really hard time reading through this one. Hambly has a habit of using really, really long sentences that makes the imagery incoherant. I'll let everybody know, I'm not the smartest kid on the block, but I still found myself really, really confused about what was going on. Sometimes she will mention things out of nowhere and I find myself continually asking, &#34;Who the hell is that?&#34; &#34;What did that paragraph just say?&#34; or &#34;Who is that character again?&#34; I also am continually asking myself, &#34;Where are we?&#34; or &#34;How did Han get his soldiers across a...bridge maybe, or under it, or beside it?&#34; For whatever reason, trying to imagine Barbara Hambly's descriptions of, well, anything, are very difficult. Sometimes her sentences would go on for an entire paragraph, big paragraphs at that, and it made it difficult to understand what thought she was attempting to convey within that sentence. Then, at the end of the paragraph, I am continually confused as to what general idea the paragraph was attempting to say. It comes off as rambling.Here's the thing. I've read a lot of Science Fiction where I would call this kind of writing 'Good Writing.' Maybe I'm too cynical about the Disney buyout now after the prequels ruining all novelization cannon in the first place. So, that may be why I'm giving this a bad review. For whatever reason, Hambley's thoughts aren't clear to me. Maybe I'm stupid, though. I just cannot visualize things in this StarWars novelization that I can easily do with others. It's just not a fun book. Star Wars should always be fun. Maybe that's why I can't love this book. Or, maybe she was high when writing it and did tend to ramble. I'll be honest, it feels like she was high and rambled a lot. If the flaw is not me, and the flaw is her, then I would guess that she got stoned while writing some of this. I've seen it before, and this is what it looks like. For comparisons, read Stephen King pre 1987. In summary, I cannot connect to this book emotionally even though it has characters in it that I have connected more easily with than any other characters in the entire history of books and cinema. Notice how long that last sentence was? That's how long every sentence is in this book. So, I'm not enjoying it, and this may be my last Star Wars purchase in the rest of my life."

""They hang there, the stars [above the Grand Canyon], like notes on a page of music, free-form verse, silent mysteries swirling in the blue like jazz."" Near the close of his book, Miller says, ""I think Christian spirituality is like jazz music. I think loving Jesus is something you feel. I think it is something very difficult to get on paper. But it is no less real, no less meaningful, no less beautiful"" (239).Miller objects to viewing Christian love as a commodity, something you give, get, or withhold. Instead, he sees it as a liberating feeling, much like the feeling some people have when listening to jazz. If you don't particularly like jazz, you may not like Miller's book or his definition of Christian love either.Blue Like Jazz is the first-person narrative of an insecure soul who is searching for unconditional love and acceptance. It is a little like Holden Caulfield (236) meets Billy Graham. Holden Caulfield/Don Miller finds most of standard Christianity to be phony. He seeks authenticity by drinking beer, smoking pot, chewing tobacco, using profanity, and perhaps engaging in premarital sex. The details are sketchy.Whatever the case, he thumbs his nose at phony Christians by living a life pretty much designed to annoy the daylights out of them, provoke a reaction, and thereby prove their Christian love to be phony and conditional. ""The problem with Christian community was that we had ethics, we had rules and laws and principles to judge each other against. There was love in Christian community, but it was conditional love"" (215).While he never really finds satisfaction in the evangelical Christianity in which he was raised, he does find meaningful conversation among the free-thinking students and professors of Reed College (37-42) and loving acceptance in a commune of marijuana-smoking hippies in Oregon (207-210). ""When I was with the hippies I did not feel judged, I felt loved"" (208). One of the narrator's problems is that, in his insecurity, he is always feeling judged. Consequently, evil is what disapproves of him and good is what he approves of, narcissistic and self-indulgent as that may be.The conclusion of the whole matter is that loving everyone unconditionally, liberal and conservative, holy and unholy, cool dude and jerk, is the only answer (221). In order to do this, you first have to love yourself so you can love others as you do yourself (231). Once again, the details of how to love people just to love them are left sketchy. It's like jazz, you either feel it or you don't.One wag has said that if you lock your wife and your dog in the trunk of a car for a few hours, you'll learn which one loves you unconditionally.Somehow, Blue Like Jazz leaves me cold. If God's love for every human being is unconditional, but He is ready to send many of them to burn in hell as the Bible teaches (2 Thessalonians 1:7-9; Revelation 20:15), then it seems to me that calling such love ""unconditional"" is absurd. Miller never explains this logical disconnect.The God of the Bible I read demands holiness, and biblical love is, in effect, conditional (Deuteronomy 7:9-11). The love of God for his creation may be continuous and strong, but salvation is contingent upon responding to that love in faith (John 3:16)and in deed (Romans 2:6-8). One day the books will be opened (Revelation 20:12), and there will be ""wrath and fury"" for those who ""obey unrighteousness""(Romans 2:6-8).Miller seems to want a new and improved version of Christianity, one remade in his own image that hates what he hates and loves what he loves. The egocentric, unbiblical theology of this book leaves me blue like depression."

By explaining the concept of Specified Complexity and thereby developing a flow-chart type Explanatory Filter, he has convincingly demonstrated a methodology to detect design. There are a number of issues that he has discussed to support his point of view but here I will only highlight one; the application of Universal Probability Bound (UPB) to put a stop to exploitation of ""chance"" by evolutionary biologists who have misused this word for 150 years. The significance of this bound must be understood by all those who are either in favor of or against the chance-based evolution theory. Let me explain it with the help of an example. If someone tells you that a normal coin (with equal probability for head and tail) was tossed trillion times and in every toss the head came up, you may not reject his statement because there is a probability, no matter how small, that it might had actually happened as reported. However, if you know the probability bound for such experiment and the stated probability falls outside this bound you can say for sure that this statement is untrue. I remember an old argument supporting chance-based events that given enough time, monkeys, and typewriters, one of the monkeys can randomly generate Shakespeare's work. Once again, if you happen to know the probability bound for this exercise, you can categorically accept or refute the statement. For so long, evolutionary biologists have mislead people to believe that given enough time there is always a probability, no matter how small, that random mutations combined with natural selection can produce complicated biological systems. Not any more! Using the UPB criterion you can now determine the validity of chance-based evolution theory. By the way, Dembski has used the most conservative value of UPB as compared to earlier values determined by some mathematicians and computer scientists, and still ""chance"" gets ruled out. I wonder if evolution biologists can truly understand the significance of UPB and utilize it on their own to determine the validity of chance-based evolution theory. I am afraid they would like to avoid such an exercise as it will expose the weakness of chance-based evolution theory and they will have no choice but to accept the only other presently available theory (ID).I recommend that anyone interested in ID vs Evolution debate should carefully read this book in order to realize the limitations of chance; you cannot just get away by simply using this word without knowing if a chance-based event is scientifically possible or not.However, I must add that the book is not that easy to read for someone with no background in probability theory despite the fact that Dembski has provided many helpful examples to explain the main concepts."
0939571234,Eco-Imperialism: Green Power Black Death,10.95,A2KG8WLR1AKO12,"David Thomson ""Second Rate Eric Hoffer Imitator""",0.7692307692307693,5,1175731200,Eco-Imperialism Will Enrage You,"Paul Driessen convincingly argues that eco-imperialism is responsible for the widespread hunger and deaths of millions. The world's poor truly pay the ultimate price tag for their nonsense. Malaria should be a minor problem. The disgraceful banning of DDT alone results in countless deaths. Eco-imperialists normally live extravagantly and it is very fair to describe them as hypocrites. One has every moral right to demand that they wear hair shirts and eat uncooked grass. There is one thing, however, that Driessen should have stressed. He overlooked the sad fact that most people are self centered and really don't care about Third World poverty. Driessen needs to remind them that the extremist also hurt them. We all pay a steep financial price tag. Our own lifestyles are negatively impacted.The author even takes to task a number of large corporations who have jumped onto this bandwagon. They do so, if for no other reason, then to earn billions of dollars from their investments in so-called green technologies. This is why they often seem so willing to partner with those dedicated to destroying capitalism. Driessen points out that the environmental crazies have no problem with funding. The big bucks only go to causes such as global warming hysteria. Government bureaucracies and the larger non-profits have often been captured by left-wing ideologues. They dictate policy and punish those daring to oppose them. I strongly encourage you to read Eco-Imperialism. You might even want to purchase copies for your friends and relatives."

I've read three of her books,The Twentieth Wife: A Novel,The Feast of Roses: A NovelandThe Splendor of Silence: A Noveland Indu Sundaresan keeps me wanting for more. Her books are historical, romantic, thrilling, captivating and much more. I don't know a clear category or genre that her books could fit in because there's a lot her books do. They gave me a history lesson and motivated me to read and research more about the Mughal Empire and India's freedom struggle. They made me nostalgic as I could feel India all around me as I read those descriptive lines that talked about the intricacies of architecture, the finesse of attire, the aroma of several delicacies, the colors of a blooming garden, the smell of the first rain... oh! the list is too long! Her books work like a time machine taking you back to that mystical era gone by.Indu Sundaresan introduces you to each of her characters with such ease that after it all you feel like you personally know all of them. It's amazing how she makes you feel for each of them. You can grow to like or dislike these people just the way you would in real life. It's amazing how she portrays certain delicate relationships and makes you feel anxious as she builds around them a whole plethora of directly or indirectly effected events. Her vivid books brought about all kinds of emotions in me..... happiness, anxiety, pride, disgust, amazement, hope and everything else you can possibly think of. I think the stories she tells are well rounded and provide a very fulfilling read. Absolutely love her books and can't wait for her next one!"

It is quite indispensable as a commentary on the catechism and now after years of being out of print, P&amp;R has seen fit to bless us!

Everest of Rivers,"For years, Tibet's Upper Tsangpo gorge had loomed as the ultimate challenge in whitewater. Carving the deepest gorge in the world (over 15,000 feet deep) and dropping in places 250 feet/mile this monsterous river had repelled every attempt to navigate it's turbulent and treacherous waters. In 1998, a group led by Wickliffe Walker attempted a first descent at 60,000 cfs+, only to have U.S. Kayak Slalom Team member Doug Gordon drown almost midway through the gorge. Their perilous journey is chronicled in the excellent book The Last River.After extensive planning using satalite imagery, a team of the world's top kayakers led by extreme filmmaker Scott Lindgren (and sponsored by GM/Outside magazine) attempted a fresh first descent in February 2002 at a more reasonable 15,000 cfs. While Lindgren and his 5 buddies were battling the rapids, Peter Heller (on assignment from Outside magazine) hiked the side canyon on a bad hip with an army of 64 porters providing logistical support. Heller chronicles the boaters' near death experiences from the relatively safe vantage point of the trail overlooking the river. Although unable to provide a personal account of the kayaking experience, his writing is brilliant, describing a Shangri-La like beauty that gives the reader a feeling of being surrounded by one of the most remote and enchanting places on Earth.Heller also vividly portrays the six personalities of this elite kayaking group; in particular focusing on the intense displeasure that Lindgren has for Heller's book proposal. He also describes an intense standoff between the porters and the expedition members, where the porters demand, on threat of death, almost twice their originally contracted pay. (This hardball bargaining style seems to be a recurring theme on many Himalayan expeditions.)He also gives a brief history of the Tibetan people following the invasion and near-destruction of this Buddhist nation by the Chinese in the 1950s. After enduring a gigantic flood along the Tsangpo in 2000, many of these indigenous people are being relocated so that China can turn this rugged region into a national park.Overall this makes for excellent adventure reading. It's good to know there are still modern day heroes conquering unconquered rivers and coming home to tell about it."

Back in the mid-60s, I was stationed at nearby Fort Rucker and married a local girl. Hence the visit.Griffin gets the flavor of the military correct and his grasp of internal politics is very good. That said, there is a formulaic feel to the books. I have the entire BoW and Corps series, along with a few others, but I haven't been drawn into any of the later books. I figure they're pretty similar to the others.My biggest problem with Griffin's books is the editing. It's lousy! The use of wrong words in some instances is a function of reliance on spell-check, I think. But some of the errors are really strange. Griffin often has pilots getting landing clearance on runways that can't exist. Runways are numbered from 01 to 36 depending on their magnetic orientation. A runway pointing 030 degrees is runway 03 -- it's as simple as that. In one book, a pilot lands on runway 83. Sheesh. This is stuff Griffin himself ought to know.Air traffic control phraseology is another problem. As a former controller, Army and FAA, I am sensitive to that. I won't get into it any further.I still like the books and I like Griffin's writing style. Like some other fans, I wish he'd left out some of the rehash that appears in most of his books and added a little blood and thunder.Jim"

Perhaps it will take another novel to perfect the Billy Bob character. I think the plot is rather confusing -- so many eccentric characters, as is JLB's signature -- and not enough focus on Billy Bob's character. JLB seems to dance around Billy Bob's ambivalence toward life, e.g., &quot;I had made a career out of living a half life,&quot; which might be a wonderful and powerful statement. This may be because the author hasn't decided who Billy Bob is. The author doesn't know Texas as he knows Louisiana. I am not from Texas, although I have been there, as well as Louisiana. The moody, lyric writing about the landscape of Louisiana in the Robicheaux books rings true, delicious and delirious, whereas the Texas scenes seem to be overwritten, as if the author is trying too hard. That may be part of the problem with this novel in general. I think JLB, nonetheless, is a top-notch literary writer in the mystery genre. He is one of the best. I look forward to his next book."

Luciano,1,2,1188345600,Survival Story,"Because of her father's treachery in attempting to assassinate the king of Morocco, Malika, her mother, her siblings and two family friends are imprisoned in the desert. For years they live in tiny cells infested with bugs and mice who battle them for their near-starvation rations. Finally they make a desperate move to tunnel out of their prison and alert the international news media of their imprisonment, which puts sufficient pressure on the king to free them.Malika's life wasn't always so bad, though. In fact, when she was five, the king adopted her to live in the palace as a companion to his daughter. Although she missed her family and felt trapped in her life as royalty, Malika was well fed and well brought up and had all of the luxuries life could hand out to a child. This makes her subsequent imprisonment all the more shocking, especially as it is at the hands of her adopted family.I found this book a bit scattered. The author would state in passing something she would then address later, which gave me the feeling of a great deal of jumping around. She also tries a bit too hard to make a connection between life in the palace and life in prison, which I thought was more than a small stretch. Although the author argues that she was never really ""free"" to do what she wanted while living with the royals, what child ever is free to do what he or she wants? There were few incidents of her being treated cruelly while growing up, and she wanted for nothing, yet she tried to paint herself as a poor sad little child. This tended to make me feel less sorry for her, rather than more.The part of the book dealing with the family's prison life was horrifying almost beyond belief, yet was dealt with in such a casual tone of voice that I found it hard to get as outraged and sad as I felt I should have been. Something about the tone of the book just didn't strike the right note with me."

This is a very good book to read but it can also get very confusing if you don't read it thoroughly. The author of this book has a very unique way of writing. The author thinks back as a child and put down everything that happened and then exaggerates it so much that it is a totally fiction book. ""Alice In Wonderland"" is not the type of book where you could skip over sentences, because you would get completely lost. This book is a magical book. It takes you into a world you never knew was there. The main character in this book is Alice. She takes many trips, not knowing that in her imagination she is making it all up. She goes from the woods, to a big hallway, into water, then into a house in which she grows larger than wanted, and then she meets a caterpillar on a mushroom. There are many other places she went and met other creatures that helped her along the way. There are many things you can learn from this book. For example Alice wanted to change her size (she wanted to be different than she was before) but then things went terribly wrong. She never went to the size she wanted to be... she either went too short or too tall. This teaches you that you should accept the way you are, because you will thank yourself in the end. You are perfect the way you are you never need to change unless you are bad and need to change into good. You could really learn a whole lot from this book but it is going to be hard for younger kids to understand. I personally recommend this book for 12 year olds and up. This book is really good, give it a try it will take you into a magnificent world and you will never want to come back!"

Henderson's stories of advanced aliens trying to survive among the knuckle-draggers of 19th and 20th century Earth, their struggle to remain true to their high ideals without betraying themselves, are immediately engrossing. And Henderson's plotting can grab you from the first sentence and pull you right along, never letting go. Her portrayal of the rural west is digital-clear.I highly recommend Henderson's People...five stars. Her afterword to the book, an explantion of how The People came to be written, is a hoot, and worth the price of admission.

The characters are well drawn. I wanted to hate Joe, but he was in so much pain that I couldn't, really. I never excused what he did - and Hulme did not ask the reader to do that. She challenges the reader to look at our society as a whole; to see what we do to people and how we as communities play a role in creating some of the violent, terrible situations that result in children being abused.I know that some people found that the mysticism in the latter section of the novel took away from the book. I disagree. I found that it fit in well with the story and helped flesh out some of the messages the author was trying to get across. Some of the imagery in this novel is absolutely breathtaking. I have never been so utterly moved and transfixed by a novel as I have by this one. It challenged my perceptions and it made me a different person when I was finished it.The book is quite long, and it can be slow in a few spots. I found that I had to read it twice. I admit I did hate Joe the first time I read the novel; I really only began to understand him the second time I read the book. This is a complex, multi-layered work that speaks to a wide range of issues: child abuse, spirituality, community, and culture.I highly recommend this novel to everyone. You may not like it or agree with it, but you will be impacted by it. It still haunts me today."

0901938300,The Craft of Musical Composition: Theoretical Part - Book 1 (Tap/159),16.47,A1KQSR91MRTWZ6,Mark Wieczorek,0.8974358974358975,5,1264291200,My favorite book on composition,"I'm a largely self-taught musician. I did take guitar lessons (from a guy who could tell what chord you were playing by ear, but had no idea what notes went into them - no theory background whatsoever), and composition/ear training lessons from a classically trained composer who got his master's at Julliard. Still, a large part of my musical education was self taught. I read a lot of books, mostly old old dusty tomes that I was lucky enough to find in reprinted editions, and rarely if ever stuff that would be considered a textbook for a classroom.My composition teacher introduced me to Hindemith, but in his Elementary Training for Musicians and Traditional Harmony books - both of which I diligently did the exercises in every week.This is by far my favorite book on the subject of composition. While there's plenty that I've learned that isn't in this book, there's so much material in here that really strikes at the heart of harmony, that it's hard not to love it... or leave it, as the case may be - a few reviewers here seem to regard it as more of a cultural oddity than a book that shines a light on the dark places. Perhaps these reviewers have had the benefit of a traditional musical education & have spent years with far thicker tomes, such as Piston's perennial classroom favorites.He begins (as did many theory books up until Hindemith's era) with an overview of the overtone series & the creation of the major scale. He goes one step beyond that, and through a series of convolutions, constructs a 12 tone scale that he derives from the overtone series (Rameau would be proud). I see the merit in this, but it seems largely academic to me. Either you'll use equal temperament in atonal composition, or you'll compose in a largely diatonic manner. Still, I applaud his effort to marry the old tonal tradition with the emerging atonal compositions that were becoming more prominent in his time. Few of us today are concerned with the precise place we need to put our fingers on the fretboard to get a properly intonated minor second, but in his day when composers were transitioning away from purely tonal music, but were not embracing equal temperament, this would have been an issue.It's worth noting that Hindemthi hated equal temperament & is glad that he doesn't believe it will take over music any time soon... published in 1942, two years after Les Paul built his first electric guitar, and less than a decade away from Leo Fender transforming the world with inexpensive, mass produced electric guitars, transforming the popular music world into one of equal temperament seemingly overnight. I find this both sad (because I suffered for many years as a musician because of the equal temperament music I grew up on was not a harmonically pure enough one for me to develop a good ear early on), and ironic, since he was on the cusp of a revolution & didn't know it.When he's done constructing the scale, he uses combination tones as a justification for the way chords are constructed - that is, if you have 3 notes, how can you definitively say one is the root? Even when in inversion, why is that note the root? To those of you who know nothing of the overtone series and think of chords as ""stacked thirds"" - I ask you - why is the root note the root? Why can you have another note in the bass, yet it's still not the root? How can you add a 7th and a 9th so that your chord has 5 notes (5 out of a possible 7 notes in the major scale), and then invert it, and still know which note is the root? Hindemith explains.From there, he places the intervals on a continuum from more harmonic to more melodic. I don't think his groupings are well accepted dogma (nor any of the things I'm talking about), but it makes good, strong, logical sense. If you play a succession of tones, why does playing 3rds and 5ths sound like you're arpeggiating a chord, but playing seconds sounds like melody? Again, Hindemith explains.Building on the above, he then breaks chords into different groupings. This may be less controversial, but his method is logical. These groupings make up the entirety of the two page appendix (unless you count his section on analysis of musical samples as part of the appendix too), so you can be sure that Hindemith believed these groupings were important for you to have on reference (though it's fairly easy to remember the groupings - simple triads, 7th & 9th chorsd, chords without a tritone, etc.).This takes up roughly the first half of the book, and lays the foundation for the second half - Hindemith's rules of Harmony. This bit is somewhat more detailed & technical, and I found it to be less ""full of insights"" than the first half, and more ""full of rules"" - which is what a great many harmony books are, so this section was a bit less valuable to me.... I say this after having read the book a year or so ago, so mostly I'm saying this because I remember fewer of the thing he said in this section, I may have been rapt in attention during this section a year ago, I just don't remember it so well now.There's also a brief section on Melody. Very few music theory books tackle melody, and Hindemith does, which is very laudable. I don't know that he adds much of significance here, but it's certainly worth going through this section, since so few treatments of melody exist.Finally, we have the aforementioned analysis of musical works, and the chart of various chord types.I found it to be quite an enjoyable read. Very concise and with little fluff, and for the most part, lite on ""rule"" and heavy on ""insights into why thing work"" - which is the sort of stuff I live for.If you want more ""rules on classical harmony"" Tchaikovsky's book is slender and hard to beat. If you're really just looking for ""music theory for dummies"" Edly's Music Theory for Busy People (available on the publisher's website) is very simple & concise, though the first few pages may be difficult for an absolute beginner. Writing Music for Hit Songs is also a great introduction to music theory (and from a pop music, not classical) standpoint, and I would recommend it to absolute beginners."

The authors provide a detailed schedule for nuclear disarmament, which they really mean as a dwindling of nuclear arms.The authors do a fantastic job of explaining the effects of nuclear power production and nuclear weapons on human life.

It's tragic that those with a narrow self-interest for publicity or the next quarter's results ever managed to keep the debate going past the point where the central fact became known: Mankind is warming the globe with greenhouse gasses and this is a problem.Fortunately most people now know that this debate is over.There is, however, plenty of debate about how best to act. The real debate is in an area we *really* don't understand: economics (if any economist fully understood their subject they'd be rich). The economic, political, entrepreneurial, civic, and national security areas are the ones that now deserve our attention. That is a better use of time than listening to the 1/10th of 1% of scientists that still dispute even the idea of global warming, or whether HIV causes AIDs, or whether sugar-free gum is better for your teeth.There are things to do, problems to solve (and money to be made).

0679755829,Remembering Satan: A Tragic Case of Recovered Memory,15,AJYGQV81FSFE2,Timothy P. Scanlon,0.75,5,958694400,Narrative of another milestone witch hunt.,"The McMartin trial, in which a family who ran a daycare center and were relentlessly pursued by overzealous prosecutors, became a milestone among late 20th century witch hunts. It was among the consequences of the proliferation of pop psych theories, social workers and therapists who love the limelight and the media who gave them that attention, the reliance on self-help fantasies and gurus, in addition to prosecutors with no integrity, and other mistakes for which we'll be paying for centuries. The story which is the basis of this fine volume--a consequence of the same rubbish--may be even more insidious than McMartin. It offered us a solid beginning of the satanic scare that continues nearly unabated with whole branches of police zealots with trigger fingers on their lighters despite a lack of evidence that would doom a case in anything less emotionally compelling.To rehash some of the incident, two young women in Washington state went to a therapist. That therapist helped the women &quot;recover the memories&quot; of incredible sexual abuse they had allegedly suffered while mere toddlers, and the culprit was none other than their father. Well, the father was a religious fundamentalist, a law enforcement officer, and a Republican activist, not exactly the stereotype of what one would expect of a child abuser. But the father was also, shall I say, gullible. He felt, well, I don't remember any of this but, heaven forbid, my girls wouldn't lie. So what they say must be true! He confessed--based on that &quot;logic&quot;--was tried and convicted.The analysis of what went on throughout the process is fascinating. For example, the more attention the daughters got, the more evil and yes, incredible the claims became. They were so outrageous--of Satanic rites including cannabalism, abortions for ritual feasts, all of the makings of a bad, low-budget 1950s horror flick--that they would have been discounted by anyone not obsessed with conviction, gaining a political point or two, or by anyone without their head stuck up any inconvenient anatomical location. And, even if there were any remote credibility to the claims, the lack of physical evidence to support them may, in a sane world, have been a clue. But one must recall that this was the beginning of the talk-show era in which the more outrageous a claim a person made, the more attention, the more press and television visibility, and, ultimately the more money he or she was able to make off the claims.The story is, however, not funny. Nor has it a happy ending. Between the girls' father getting a long prison sentence (He rescinded his admission but too late.) and many other people in the community having their lives irreparably ruined, it is an event to take very, very seriously.One analysis that bears some reflection is that much of the &quot;recovered memory&quot; theory on which this phenomenon was based is ultimately Freudian. Yet many of the feminists and New Agers who endorse it claim that Freud was a despicable sexist. Maybe I'm making the mistake of believing that some of these people are capable of reason. And that may be a pipe dream.I heartily recommend the book. It's not a long, arduous read despite the subject matter. And, God-willing, we'll learn something about these events before more families, communites, and careers are destroyed, and law enforcement professionals lose even more credibility. Perhaps too we can contemplate the severe punishment those irresponsible prosecutors and police, and especially the &quot;mental health professionals&quot; should suffer for their crimes once the tide turns.There are, incidentally, other volumes I would recommend on the subject too, but most of them are commentaries. This is a documentary, a history, with limited examination. As a history, it is of immense value."

But in spite of the slight problems in this story, I loved it. I agree with other readers -- where are the second and third books?? You don't need the subtitle, ""Mayflower Trilogy,"" to notice that there are loose threads that are obviously left for subsequent books to sort out.I have re-read this book multiple times, and find myself speculating on whether the 2nd and 3rd books would be from Lovelock's point of view as well, or perhaps Diana's, Peter's, Neeraj's, or even Causo's.We all know Orson Scott Card generally has more on his plate than he can handle at any one time. People have been pestering him for more books in the Alvin Maker saga. Until he came out with Shadow of the Giant, they waited impatiently for THAT. He has the feminist series featuring women of the Bible. AND he writes ""other"" books as well -- poetry, vaguely supernatural books (I don't know a better classification for Lost Boys and Homebody) and non-fiction as well. I expect he just doesn't have time to come back to little Lovelock and his pals on the Ark.But I don't have to like it. Maybe if he and Katheryn Kidd already have the outline of the rest of the Lovelock saga, SHE could write it. I don't know if this is the solution, but the crew of the ark have been hanging around in limbo for SEVERAL years now, I think it's high time they were allowed to progress on their journey.My vote is, READ MORE ORSON SCOTT CARD!!! He doesn't HAVE any books I DON'T recommend. And don't get caught up in any particular genre -- his historical fiction is just as well -thought out as his science fiction, so make sure you don't miss his book, Saints, for instance."

I wasn't disappointed. It was easy and entertaining reading with a good format. The organization of the book is very helpful to enable people to put together the histories of various civilizations. I now have a clear picture of how the Inca, Mayan, and Aztec fit into the scope of world history (and numerous other cultures and historical figures are now clear in my mind).That said, there were a few annoyances. The first and biggest, was the FREQUENT use of parenthetical statements referring the reader to other sections of the book for more information about a particular subject. Not only did these interrupt the flow of thought, but they were generally useless (vaguely referring the reader to another chapter, but not telling where within the chapter the subject is covered). Either eliminating these completely or placing them in the margin would have greatly improved the readability of the book.The second annoyance was that there were some obvious errors in the information given. The accepted age of the earth, as mentioned by another reviewer, was one. He repeated the false urban legend that the nursery rhyme &quot;Ring Around the Rosie&quot; came from the black plague. There were a few other errors I detected as well. This made me question the level of research the author did and raised doubts about the accuracy of other sections (though in general I think it was pretty accurate).Overall, I'd recommend this for anyone that wants a readable introduction into world history. It would be helpful for either a student currently studying it or an adult wanting a refresher course."

1932907009,Save The Cat! The Last Book on Screenwriting You'll Ever Need,12.37,A3A1YMXPN16SYA,Marineboy,1,4,1280102400,"not perfect, but pretty good","To those other reviewers that complain about the scripts this author has sold and/or had made into films, they have a point. Both of his produced movies seem to be instantly forgettable. However, it is a fact in life that those who do a thing best are not necessarily the same as those who teach it best. I have seen that principle made flesh in hundreds of different ways.Save the Cat is not as shimmeringly brilliant as some claim it is, but it isn't half bad either, and certainly not as bad as some claim it is. There is a lot of sound advice here, even if much of it has existed in previous forms elsewhere. Snyder's main success is to boil a very tricky and subtle process down to something that can be digested and thus internalized.But that is probably also its risk. As others have pointed out, this tendency towards reduction drives the advice given in the direction of formula. In my opinion (not being an expert however) this is the one area of Blake Snyder's advice you would do well to treat with some skepticism, especially (and surprisingly) since he drops hints that he wants you to follow his ""cheat sheet"" more or less to the letter (i.e. to the page number).My suspicion would be that seasoned script readers in Hollywood can ""smell"" any script that has emerged as the output of any individual's formulaic ""method"" a mile away, and in that scent they can probably even discern fairly quickly which method or which guru it is. Such a script is likely to describe a short throwing arc into the trash can.These cautions aside though, Save the Cat has a lot of helpful advice, especially when combined with a number of other books that do what this one does not, and which travel deeper into story. It certainly is not the last book on screenwriting you will ever need. It's probably better if it is your first, learn his rules, and then be prepared to break them, or at least bend them."

He only provides *one* technique for queen introduction (albeit a good one), when there are several others.

0884118185,Captains Courageous,23.95,A3B1VHNCY7OLXW,Edgar Lipsey,1,4,1186531200,No courage needed for this pleasant read,"When I started this book, I couldn't help but make some comparisons to Jack London's, Sea Wolf. The protagonist is picked up by a boat at sea and wants to be dropped off on shore, but the captain refuses and, instead, solicits his help on the ship's voyage, hoping to teach him something about real work along the way. And right about there the two novels diverge. While Jack London's, Sea Wolf goes through an increasingly complicated plot and conflict, Rudyard Kipling's, Captains Courageous simply lets us in on the cruise. Though they take two very different courses, I think that they both succeeded in their separate endeavors. Kipling relies on his description and scenes to set the story before us, and he achieves this masterfully. Describing life on board a fishing vessel could very easily turn out to be tedious, but Kipling uses such nice language and great characters that you almost feel as if you are there experiencing it with them, through the good and the bad. The ending is hardly surprising, but more importantly it feels right. One thing to note is that, while Kipling does describe things fairly well, this is still written back in the age of sail, so many of the terms are taken for granted for someone not well versed in that era. If that is the case, the reader might feel lost for a good portion of the story. Still, the writing is pleasant enough that you almost don't need to know what is going on, you're just happy to be along for the ride."

Carson had advocated that the methods we employ for pest control must be such that they do not destroy us along with the insects. Yet today, despite the lip service we pay to Silent Spring, and in spite of considerable environmental protest, public outcry and the availability of viable alternatives, we still choose to spray chemical pesticides at an alarming rate. In fact, chemical pesticides still remain our pest control method of choice.Our attitude is to approach pests as organisms to control rather than manage; we exterminate instead of reduce; we dominate rather than learn to accommodate. Why this sad state of affairs remains so is a central theme of this book, which introduces the concept of pest management (as opposed to pest control). Pest management forces us to look beyond the immediate benefits and disadvantages, costs and side effects, of pest control methods towards choosing alternatives that are more environmentally compatible and less harmful to our own health. The author explores scientifically exciting alternative technologies such as biological control, yet admits, as the 1990 gypsy moth invasion of Vancouver has shown, that the public needs more education and assurance on its safety and environmental correctness.This book provides such an education and forms the basis for novel biologically based strategies involving pheromones, parasitic insects, bio-engineered crops and pest diseases to become standard practice.Mark L. Winston is professor of biological sciences at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia, Canada. He is the author of two previous books, The Biology of the Honey Bee and Killer Bees."

""Spectacle lynchings,"" widely-publicized acts of mob vigilance, gave rise to a rhetoric of retribution in the blues, understandably directed toward white oppressors, but also more tragically toward black bodies and souls. The complex burden of the blues, Gussow argues, is to perform rites of exorcism that re-enact violence without the comfort of catharsis or transubtantiation, the usual consequences of tragedy.His chapters successively explore the subjects of lynchings, dismemberment, murder, riot, and knifings, each time through a central author or text, set amidst a rich array of ancillary texts and voices. The chapters are models of rigorous historical research and intelligently modulated critical discussion. This book is an accurate and eloquently argued work of cultural imagination.

I thought the structure of the book was fabulous. The workbook format was incredibly helpful--asking questions for you to really think about and get a handle on where and how a house or sign or planet fits in your life. The tone of the book was like having a conversation with your own personal astrologer--weaving in stories from her own background as well as illustrating points via the twelve people she profiled was excellent. It helped me visualize and understand the complexities of different planet/sign/house etc. interactions. I also liked the easy to understand explanations of squares, trines, oppositions. And probably the most important thing I loved about the book and about Elizabeth Campbell's take on astrology is her non-judgemental stance and focus on the positive. She might explain how different things could derail you, or challenge you, but it is always with a healthy dose of how to spin the dice in a positive fashion.

The autobiography contained within ""Left to Tell"" is inspiring and almost too incredible to believe. A college student at the time of the Rwandan holocaust, Immacul&eacute;e Ilibagiza lived through the horrific events that took place during that time and has chosen to share her first-hand experience with all willing to learn. I found this book to be astonishing; it opened my eyes to a historical event I had barely heard of and hope to never hear happen again. Before reading ""Left to Tell,"" I knew very little about the terrible events of Rwanda's recent past but that all changed 215 pages later. Immacul&eacute;e's account is riveting due to her explicit retelling of what she miraculously lived through. She talks openly about the shocking and barbaric ways that human beings can be led to act if hatred takes complete control of their hearts. While telling of the evils that occurred in Rwanda, she takes the reader on a journey through the development of her unshakable faith. By turning her heart and life over to God during the holocaust, Immacul&eacute;e found love, peace, and the ability to forgive those who hunted her and other Rwandan Tutsis. ""Left to Tell"" is a wonderful account that I found difficult to put down. The events that Immacul&eacute;e went through and recounts are horrific and for that reason I would save this book for older audiences."

The novel is about a girl, Yingtai, who wanted to go to college, but college was prohibited for girls. Yingtai dresses as a man to go to school, and when she got there, she fell in love. Her only problem was that she needed to tell the boy, Shanbo, that she in fact was a girl, and that she loved him. Then, Yingtai went home, only to find out that her father found her a rich guy to marry. Yingtai soon had to make a decision. Would she marry the one she loved, or the man with the wealth?I really enjoyed reading Butterfly Lovers. I liked the novel because after the turn of every page, something new occurred. Butterfly Lovers kept you on your toes; always wondering what was going to happen next.

There, she encounters Aeneas Manston, the incredibly handsome and charming steward of Miss Auclyffe, and also a man with a dark secret. He falls hopelessly in love with the beautiful girl and sets out to win her. But alas, Cytherea is already in love with the kind Edward Springrove. Who will ultimately win her? What is the mysterious connection between the steward Manston and Miss Auclyffe?

The references cited are the &quot;masters.&quot; This book does not waste the reader's time with silly humor or unnecessary material.I hope there will be a second edition.

It is very tough going--this was adapted from Meyer's doctoral dissertation, but it repays every effort made. Meyer's mind is enviably far-ranging; he uses examples from the visual arts to the hard sciences and philosophy to make his points. His later book, Explaining Music, is an easier read, still full of valuable insights but much more oriented toward a theoretical, quasi-Schenkerian approach to music.

0863563120,Menstruation: A Novel (Saqi Books),10.95,A342ONN7T5T2M7,yaman,0.5,5,1159660800,"A book about sexual limits, spiritual epiphanies, and social confinement...","We do not remember our histories or our lives by those dull periods of conscious stasis; rather, we look upon those pivotal moments where our world-views are shaken, our emotions in shambles, and our futures unpredictable, as being the ones most important to defining ourselves. If it is indeed those moments of change that capture the essence of the human condition and define the individual, then Ammar Abdulhamid's taboo challenging Menstruation is about them; it is a novel about epiphanies. Menstruation is a ground-breaking novel, if not in its conclusion about the universality of the ""Religion of Love,"" then in its noteworthy perspective from that of a former Muslim raised in Syria.Not shy with his subject matter, Abdulhamid does not hesitate to introduce the controversial subject matter of his book at the outset. The central character in the novel, Hasan, has refined his ability to identify menstruating women after years of scavenging through trash dumps for used tampons and developing a complicated classification system by odor and color. A peculiar admixture of revulsion and comedy, Hasan's sixth sense has a cleansing effect on the reader's mind, allowing for the complete absorption of other more pertinent issues presented in the text. Hasan's fetish for menstruation, which originates in his faulty belief that the fetus is nurtured upon blood in the womb, is later explained in one of the many interstitial narratives as being a symbolic purge in the human body; and, just as this purge occurs physiologically, it occurs also as ""intellectual"" and ""spiritual menstruation."" We are reminded, though, that despite the unsavory image of the menstrual cycle, that it ""also denotes an ability to to bring forth a new life in this world""--whether it be intellectual, spiritual, or physical. These cycles, then, are the opportunities at which the personal epiphany manifests itself.A recurring theme throughout the novel is that of the characters' sexual exploits. We become intimate with Wisam, an unsatisfied married woman who wants love-not-sex from her begrudging husband, and her adventures into lesbianism and infidelity. The brutal and dehumanizing nature of the sex Wisam has with her husband contrasted with the orgasmic and convivial encounters she has with Batul and Fatin, two other women, demands that the definition of ""love"" and its relationship with social norms be challenged. Indeed, these encounters and the many others throughout the book do serve a higher intellectual purpose besides being provocative as explained in the unpublished final chapter of the book. At the same time, they also affect Wisam personally. ""Nice people can't be devils regardless of certain acts of theirs,"" she repeats to herself as she makes love to Fatin. ""How can a sin feel so right?"" How is it that sex with her husband was okay but wholly unsatisfying and somewhat torturous, while this supposedly insidious encounter fulfilled her needs physically and emotionally?While Wisam never formally rejects her faith in Islam despite such heretical questions, other characters like Hasan, Batul, and Fatin do take this step, though not publicly at first. Batul, another married woman, openly states that she does not believe and intends to leave everything behind when the opportunity presents itself--Fatin, on the other hand, is a brave sixteen year-old veil-wearing teenager who revels in privately mocking the other women that attend religious study sessions with her. She is in a similar social situation as Hasan who, as the son of an acclaimed imam, is forced to be quiet in his new beliefs until he can establish his own financial independence from his father. Despite this apparent duplicity, there is nothing malicious about Hasan and Fatin's move towards intellectual freedom. Hasan, for example, authentically strives to reconcile his doubts by consulting his religious sister-in-law. Nevertheless, during this coming-of-age he comes to the conclusion that ""the more in need of faith [he] grow[s], the less capable of faith [he] become[s]."" Together, Hasan and Fatin illustrate another pressure of modern Syrian society: that, despite the supposedly secular nature of the ruling authoritarian regime, pressures against religious freedom continue to exist within society, manifesting themselves in the pragmatic considerations one must take regarding familial, fraternal, and financial relations.A review of Menstruation would be incomplete without noting the unique and innovative narrative style that Abdulhamid adopts. Chapters are organized by the perspective of one or more of the characters, and are further subdivided and classified according to function: innermost thoughts, for example, are separated from the narration of events. This organization allows us to witness the secretive natural thoughts that oft occur but are rarely shared, given the superstitious nature in which we understand them. According to the Qur'an, for example, such thoughts should prompt the recitation of certain incantations against ""the evil whisperer... who whispers in the breasts of mankind."" Nevertheless, because of Abdulhamid's approach, we are completely aware of Hasan's lust for his sister-in-law and his heretical thoughts regarding religion.More importantly, though, this organization allows for the easy introduction of a number of characters, many of whom never meet each other during the story. It is through this technique that we are allowed to be acquainted with the brilliant academic work of married couple Nadim Qanawati and Kindah Kayali, who function in the novel as the intellectual 'mentors' of other characters, and whose moral clarity serves as the basis of the novel's narrative framework. Indeed, it is through Nadim and Kindah that we understand the threatening position Hasan and others are in--under the former's guidance, Hasan and others participate in a secretive club for like-minded individuals. Nadim, who could very well be an older and more mature version of Hasan, writes of this secrecy with disgust and horror:""You could be the greatest killer of all time, the hungriest of all known assassins, the most infamous shedder of blood, human blood, in all of our glorious history, still, you will never be able to stir up, to tap into, as much feeling of hatred in people's souls as can a simple, but earnest, jotter of words. We, the thinkers of the world, are forever an accursed and undesired breed.""Ultimately, Nadim and Kindah's message is one of self-empowerment and individualism: as Nadim explains whilst between the bed-sheets with Kindah, ""I am my own messiah, you are your own messiah, everybody is his own messiah."" The importance of Nadim and Kindah to the meaning of the novel cannot be overestimated, and yet I cannot elaborate thoroughly on it without risking a ""spoiler"" about too much of the novel's content or its conclusion. I am also unable to touch on a number of other themes expressed in the novel, such as the importance of the heretic to human progress, the threat to the heretic from all parties (from the CIA to the Islamists to the Syrian government, as Nadim explains), and the status of women, among others. Thus, I will leave those tasks to the reader who makes his way through the pages of this book."

1591090245,Wuthering Heights,12.99,A3OIHHHSUGHIOM,Melody & Words,1,4,1287360000,The Corpse Bride has nothing on the Brontes!,"SummaryWuthering Heights is a dark tale of enduring passion and violent love. Set on the wild, rugged Yorkshire moors of northern England, this classic gothic novel follows the story of Heathcliff and Catherine Earnshaw, adopted siblings and lifelong lovers. Narrated through the diary of Mr. Lockwood, a tenant of nearby Thrushcross Grange, this strange and fantastic story tells of a love that transcends all boundaries--even death.Mr. Lockwood is paying a polite visit to his landlord, Heathcliff, when he is expectedly stranded there during a snowstorm. Forced to stay the night at Wuthering Heights, despite Heathcliff's clear displeasure, Lockwood finds an unoccupied room in the grand house. Unable to sleep, however, he stumbles upon the diary entries of a young girl named Catherine Earnshaw, who writes of adventures with her young friend Heathcliff. After nodding off to sleep, Lockwood is awakened when the Catherine's ghost appears at his window, pleading to be let in.When Lockwood returns to Thrushcross Grange the next day, he asks his housekeeper, Ellen (Nelly) Dean, to tell him the story of Heathcliff and the others at Wuthering Heights. Nelly begins her story thirty years earlier, when Mr. Earnshaw brings home an orphaned Heathcliff to raise with his own children, Hindley and Catherine.Though Catherine and Heathcliff are, for many years, inseparable despite Hindley's cruel persecution, eventually the two seem to drift apart. Catherine becomes a proper young lady, and since Hindley forces Heathcliff to work in the fields after their father's death, Heathcliff becomes ignorant and angry. Catherine chooses to marry Edgar Linton, a rich neighbor whom she naively believes will take care of her and Heathcliff. However, Heathcliff interprets this move as rejection, and he runs away for several years.When he returns, he has mysteriously acquires wealth and prestige, though his brooding nature has not been appeased. He has vowed revenge against all of those who have wronged him. When Catherine is confronted by her two loves, Edgar and Heathcliff, she falls ill and dies after giving birth to Cathy. Before she dies, however, she and Heathcliff reassert their undying love to each other.Now, many years later, Heathcliff is more embittered than ever, and he lives to torment the offspring of his long-dead enemies. But he is constantly conscious of Catherine's post-mortem presence, and he is pulled toward eternal love and happiness with her beyond the grave.AnalysisDespite the many narratives-within-a-narrative (the story is a diary entry, often recording Nelly's narrative, who in turn often relates the detailed speeches of others), I found the story surprisingly easy to follow on audiobook. I enjoyed listening to the heavily accented speech of Joseph and other characters, though I also checked a paperback out from the library to understand what they were actually saying!Nelly's judgmental comments about the devilish behavior of Catherine and Heathcliff, which only seems to worsen with time, make the pair seem irresponsible and deserving of any punishment that they receive. Nelly supports this viewpoint with the opinions of Edgar Linton and Hindley, both of whom despise Heathcliff and become frustrated with Catherine, and she portrays the lovelorn couple as ungrateful and spiteful.It struck me as odd that such a seemingly selfish and cruel pair would feel so deeply for each other. In my experience, relationships between truly destructive people such as Catherine and Heathcliff never end well. But their love persists and even grows stronger with each passing year.All of the other characters in the story judge the actions of Catherine and Heathcliff quite harshly, but their persecution only serves to strengthen the depth of feeling between the two. Every time Nelly criticizes their irreverent and even cruel behavior, I felt more sympathy and understanding for them and I began identifying with the persecuted couple. No one believes in them but themselves, and that is what makes their love so powerful and endearing.I found Wuthering Heights to be an enjoyable read; even more than Jane Eyre. Such a powerful story of love and loss ages well, and the unconventional use of an unreliable narrator had an interesting effect upon my view of the characters and story.The very subtle addition of Catherine's ghost, which could be interpreted as real or could be read as merely a figment of Lockwood's and Heathcliff's imaginations, does not diminish the credibility of the story. On the contrary, the supernatural elements throughout the novel only serve to add to the dark, intense feelings between the two lovers."

Olivia dashes from Miami to LA to Egypt to just about everywhere in the world in a very short time and manages to meet everyone from gun wielding kidnappers to Brad Pitt. It's a wacky, fast paced read."

The other reviews I have read point out all sorts of details that were wonderful or disappointing. The mystery wasn't very mysterious? OK. The way I read it, they knew who it was, they just needed proof. It wasn't really about the mystery, anyway. My favorite part was when Devil recognized that Fate had thrown his match right in front of him. How refreshing that the hero was the one pushing for marriage, and the heroine was as marriage-shy as any typical male. The whole point of reading (for me) is to escape. The more unrealistic the situation, the better. Why escape into a world the same as the one you're leaving? I want the romantic couple to do things like defy social conventions and change their minds in two seconds, and especially to fall in love at first glance. That's romance."

Only Jean Craighead George could write such a comprehensible and informative children's book about nature. While they're not JULIE OF THE WOLVES or MY SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN, Ms. George's Ecological Mysteries Series are sure to be enjoyable for any naturalist--inspiring and educational. In THE MISSING 'GATOR OF GUMBO LIMBO, Liza K. Poole lives with her mother and some eccentric neighbors in the heart of the Florida Everglades. (Anyone who was born to live in a tent and fish for food will be envious of this &quot;wild&quot; lifestyle.) When the woods peoples' &quot;dragon&quot;, a regal alligator, disappears, they begin to try to track down the great beast, especially Liza K. A ranger is after the gator, for he has been frightening nearby home-dwellers, and should be shot. Liza K. and her unique friends--including a talkative African gray parrot-- go through a series of clues to find out where the gator has disappeared to. The ending, I admit, is slightly disappointing--the threat of the ranger seems to be forgotten after the gator is found, Liza K. and her neighbors must abandon their way of life--but all in all, it's a fine read. The other Eco-Mysteries should be kept in mind--WHO REALLY KILLED COCK ROBIN?, in which a boy tries to solve the mystery of his clean town's feathered mascot; THE CASE OF THE MISSING CUTTHROATS, quite a lot like THE MISSING 'GATOR; and THE FIRE BUG CONNECTION.

After studying the Jewish laws of burial and the role of the Chevra Kadisha (burial society), they formed their own Chevra and began to offer thier members the option of a plain pine box, to be provided for free by the congregation.This is a reprint of a book that first came out in 1981. At that time, I was living in Minneapolis, where these events took place, so many of the people involved are personally familiar to me. Rabbi Arnold Goodman, the author, was the pulpit rabbi at the synagogue. The story was also featured as a TV documentary, which received wide acclaim at the time.The many challenges that the congregation faced -- ranging from paranoia by the funeral industry to concerns about government burial ordinances to opposition within their own membership -- are all covered here in detail. In addition, Rabbi Goodman discusses many important issues surrounding Jewish funerals. I highly recommend this book as a primer to any congregation -- Jewish or not -- that is considering a return to simple funerals."

Fortunately, you only have to tackle it an hour at a time. Dave doesn't do things half-way; his attitude seems to be ""Why wouldn't you want to be the best in whatever you do?""

It is really deep and seriously disturbing yet moving and encouraging at the same time!! In the midst of her hell of emotional/physical/mental/sexual abuse by her mother and father, Clareece Precious Jones finds strength, courage and wisdom to want better for herself and her children that came into the world in ways she had no desire for them to be reproduced. The initial moving from her main school to a specialized school (due to her pregnancy) where she finds an oasis in her fellow peers and her teachers is what makes her look towards a better future. In this school she is confronting differences in people that she really never gave much thought to (hispanic girl, lesbian peer & teacher and carribean peer) and it helps to shape her perception and understanding of differences in people for the first time in her life. Sadly with her household she grew up in she had no kind of nurturing or training to understand and interprete the differences in people (other than listening to tapes of Minister Farrakhan who she admires). It seems as though there are times Precious dreams her life in a fantasy world in which her looks are different and to me seems to equate that (being thinner, longer hair, light skin, being in ""true love"" with a boy) as having a better life. I found it ironic for her to be in school and to be reading ""The Color Purple"" with both stories having similarities in main characters yet in different eras!Her teacher who encourages her students' to write is what gives Precious the opportunity to not only learn how to read and write but also to keep a journal of the goings on of her daily living and her struggles she deals with of her mother, father, her two kids and additional heavy stuff down the road. Unlike the social worker she speaks with who has on file the way her prejudice mindset sees her, Precious sees beyond what that paper says about her towards a better and brighter future for herself and her kids and learns to ""push"" her way past her hell to see just that courtesy of her writing and the support from an ""extended"" family she becomes a part of!!"

I was pleased to see &quot;Hannibal&quot; come along, thinking &quot;more fascinating, rich character/plot development.&quot; I picked it up in Book on Tape form. The reader was initally disappointing but soon settled in with richly satisfying impressions of Jodi Foster and Anthony Hopkins (perfect Lecter) and the new character Nason. The book is richly developed, I think. For a while this kept me interested, intrigued, anticipating the plot turns. BUT, the book delves into some truly gruesome depths that I really did not need to plumb.I am not that squeamish and am more curious and tough-minded than many, perhaps. But some of the images developed in the book, I never needed to see. I can well imagine some readers, should they persist in turning the pages, would certainly grow nauseous and not a few may throw up!By way of analogy, using erotic media, I feel there is a not-so-fine line between titillation and torture. A line beyond which brutal sadism dwells. I feel Thomas in &quot;Hannibal&quot; has crossed well beyond such a line. Many may argue he did so in &quot;Lambs&quot;, and maybe so.

Good investment for the price.First, my native language is Chinese. I have been in the US for six years; and have had no intensive training in English. I consider myself an average, or slightly above average, ESL learner. Like many native speakers of syllabic languages, I had a tendency to apply the stress and intonation patterns of my first language when speaking English. In addition, I used certain vowels interchangeably. Listening to radio or hiring a tutor did not help much because I still couldn't figure out what to listen for and how I should sound. I always felt uncertain when speaking English.The American Accent Guide has definitely been a big help and is the most insightful material I have used. The lessons can work as individual modules, but if you go through them in order a few times you will see that the organization is integral to gradually raising your awareness of how the speech factors work together to form the American accent.The American Accent Guide also does a great job in conveying the ideas through integrating visual and audio aids. The Rhythm section is a good example: the practice sentences come with markings to show the stress in sentences, and the CD walks you through sets of sentences that have the same rhythm structure, which brilliantly demonstrate the idea of how to use stress and rhythm to improve the flow of speaking. It's really a very intuitive and effective approach that helps with both speaking and listening comprehension.Another strength of the material is that the practice sentences are quite useful in daily life, unlike many ESL textbooks with phrases that have little practical use and get boring after a few repetitions.In short, the American Accent Guide is a well thought-out and executed study guide for ESL students of all levels One can listen to it again and again and each time learn something new to work on. In terms of bang-per-buck, I think one will be hard-pressed to find a better investment."

Multiple studies done in the year since Katrina have all shown that it was white people -specifically elderly white people- who where disproportionately affected by the storm. You would think a ""scholarly work"" would know that.(Unlike what CNN tells you) more white people died per capita than blacks. (google is your friend) The reason is simple. The ""lower 9th ward"" is relatively small neighborhood and most of its citizens where in the Superdome. The section of town called Lakeview however is far larger and populated (well, was populated) by a large number of elderly white people. Many of these people had medial conditions or simply could not drive the 6+ hours to safety so they took their chances. These people died by the hundreds.[again, you can google all of this]Further the book bashes, ""George W. Bush's America and more specifically the Republican-dominated South.""Ok... New Orleans has a Democrat mayor and has for decades. There are no Republicans on the city council. We have a Democrat Governor and we've only had one Republican Senator since Reconstruction. - And this book wants to blame Katrina on Republican domination? It's fantasy, pure fantasy.And if you think I'm shilling for Republican's, I assure you I am not. If you want to know the true story of Katrina, I would HIGHLY recommend ""Disaster: Hurricane Katrina and the Failure of Homeland Security""It is highly critical of the Bush administration -even if- Bush proper actually did a good job before, during and after the storm. (You have to read the book, Bush really did OK, many of his people should be hung however.) And the book also makes Blanco (a Dem) look much better than any of us locals thought of her.The story of Katrina is amazingly complex. If you think -and want to continue to believe- that it only hit black people, then this book is for you. If you want to believe it is all the Democrats' fault, I'm sure you can find a book out there to confirm that. If you want to believe it is all Republicans' fault, this book should be on your short list.If you want amazingly accurate information however, read ""Disaster: Hurricane Katrina and the Failure of Homeland Security.""This book however should be in the fiction section. 10 minutes with google will debunk the whole ""scholarly work"" billing."

Maine novelist Van Reid now has published a series of his comic, sweet novels, each more pleasurable than the last, featuring Tobias Walton and his companions Ephram, Eagleton and Thump. His most recent offering, Daniel Plainway: Or the Holiday Haunting of the Moosepath League, is the perfect Christmastime or winter fireside book. Woven with so many pleasurable amiable asides and subplots, the main story about a kidnaped boy and ancient Norse writings seems almost an afterthought. To take one example, Walton, whom Reid describes as ""himself a pearl, and good things did seem to surround him"", starts the novel losing his hat in a sudden wind; the peregrinations of that topper itself, and the goodwill it seems to bear from its owner, flow delightfully through the story. In another delightful scene, Reid waxes rhapsodically on the perfect qualities of snow for snowballs, leading to a delightful snowfall fight involving the novel's heros, villains, and local youngsters. A particularly pleasurable turn for me, a former classicist, is that the interpretation of the writings depends on hearing the Greek spoken in a seemingly nonsensical English phrase, ""she'll bust her feeding."" Although always lighthearted, Reid's novel is not without serious purpose, as expressed in the dialogue as to whether ""there are so many people in the world willing to drive tragedy"" or whether ""there are as many, more, really, who are willing to put things right.""

1847026567,Barchester Towers (Large Print),36.9,A369VS3F6SQMKB,John Martin,1,5,1230768000,An overlooked gem,"Anthony Trollope, like Miniver Cheevy, was born at the wrong time and in the wrong place. Nineteenth century England produced some of the greatest novelists the world has ever known--Dickens, Austin, the Bronte sisters, Hardy, etc. In this company Trollope has been somewhat lost and that is unfortunate. His books are interesting and filled with humor, pathos and the stuff of life. They are also literate (Trollope was especially versed in the Greeks and Shakespeare), full of good humor and provide lessons for life. It is clear from the limited number of reviews on Amazon.com that Trollope is not widely read. It is equally clear from the mostly positive results that he is a good writer who should get more attention.Barchester Towers is the second of the six books in the Barsetshire series. The books run in historical sequence but can be read independently. The first in the series, The Warden, tells of Mr. Harding and his younger daughter, Eleanor. Rev. Harding is forced to resign as the warden (a kind of manager/minister) of a hospital for elderly men because the salary is too high. He is exposed by John Bold, a reformer, and a local newspaper. But Harding is a good man and he accepts the situation gracefully; his daughter, in fact, marries Bold who then dies but leaves his widow well off financially and with a baby boy.Barchester Towers picks up the story at that point and switches the focus to another group of largely religious individuals. It should be noted that the novel is not about religion as much as it is about power. On the other hand it would be a good idea to know something about the Church of England, such as what the various religious titles represent (archdeacon, dean, vicar, prebendary, etc.), as well as the attitude of the two political parties (Whigs and Tories) toward religion.At the start of the novel the bishop of Barchester dies and a new bishop, Dr.Proudie, is appointed in his place. Proudie is a short, indecisive man who is dominated by his wife. He picks Obadiah Slope as his second in command. Slope is reminiscent of Dickens' sly, scheming Uriah Heep. His objective is to be the de facto bishop, a position that Mrs. Proudie aspires to in her own way as well. Set against this trio are the local Barchester clergy led by Archdeacon Grantly. The recently deceased bishop was the archdeacon's father and the son hoped to succeed to the office. The ambitious Grantly takes an instant dislike to the officious Mr. Slope and their rivalry is one of the main focuses of the bookA number of other characters and sub-plots suffuse the novel. The Stanhope family--mother, father, two daughters and son, soon arrive on the scene. This group includes Madeline, a beautiful but physically impaired young woman who toys with men's affections and Bertie, a shiftless but essentially decent young man. Also joining the cast is the Rev. Mr. Arabin, brought in by the archdeacon to help combat Mr. Slope. The other major plot is the efforts of three men to secure the hand of the widow Eleanor Bold. Slope is one schemer who is primarily intent on securing her money. Bertie Stanhope, the irresponsible prodigal son in the Stanhope family is also encouraged to marry her for her fortune. Finally there is Mr. Arabin, a decent man, but inexperienced in matters of love. Early in the book (page 112) Trollope enters the story to reassure the reader that ""It is not destined that Eleanor shall marry Mr. Slope or Bertie Stanhope."" This tactic, engaged in by other British writers (Fielding for example) can be irritating, but Trollope does it in a good humored way.The central power struggle involves who shall be appointed to the Warder position which has now been restructured. The archdeacon pulls for Mr. Harding to be reappointed, while Mrs. Proudie pumps for the Rev. Mr. Quiverful who has a wife and 14 children to look after and needs the income the job will provide. Mr. Slope slides between the two contenders, depending on how he sees his advantage. When another position opens up, that of Dean, the stakes get even higher.The novel reaches a climax at a party given by an elderly matron, Miss Thorne. Eleanor's two ill suited suitors make their pitch, Trollope's caution to the reader comes true, and the novel proceeds to a happy ending for almost everyone.A final comment. I read a news report recently that president-elect Obama will stop reading novels and spend more time in the gym because of what he sees as the increased demands on his new job. That is, in my view, a big mistake. Novels give us insights into how to live our own lives and we are all better off for reading them. For example in Barchester Towers there is a scene between Archdeacon Grantly and Mr. Williams in which Mr. Williams has received a letter from Mr. Slope for his daughter. Both men object to Slope both as an individual and especially as a suitor for Eleanor. The archdeacon gets very angry and says that Eleanor has disgraced him and that if she marries Slope he will not have anything further to do with her. Mr. Williams, on the other hand, while equally distressed at the prospects of his daughter marrying Slope, says that he will accept that choice and continue his relationship with her. Here we have a clear difference in character. The archdeacon will only have friendship with people who agree with his views--much as George Bush's comment after 9/11, ""you are with us or you are against us."" But we can't live in a world like that. We have to live as Mr. Williams suggests, by accepting that other people can have different views from our own. So lets hope Obama spends less time on the treadmill and more time on Trollope!"

1854596209,Hamlet (The Shakespeare Folios),25.13,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""",0,5,1268092800,It harrows me with fear and wonder,"""Hamlet"" doesn't need any introduction -- the tortured Dane, the ghost, meditations on suicide and a climax full of death. But as well-known as the storyline is, the play itself is what deserves the attention, both for Shakespeare's shadowy plot filled with uncertainty and treachery -- and for his brilliant, immortal writing, which takes on a new dimension when read on the page.Prince Hamlet of Denmark is understandably upset when, only a short time after his father's death, his mother Gertrude marries his uncle Claudius, who is now the new king. Who wouldn't be unhappy? But when Hamlet encounters the tormented ghost of his father (""I am thy father's spirit/Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night""), he learns that his dad was murdered by his uncle -- but he's plagued by indecision, since he's unsure if the spirit was truly his dad.In response to this vision, Hamlet's behavior becomes more bizarre and erratic -- he dumps his girlfriend Ophelia, arranges a play that mimics real life a little too closely, and generally acts like a loon. But when an argument with his mother ends in tragedy -- and the death of one of Ophelia's loved ones -- Hamlet's fate is sealed as Claudius begins plotting to get rid of him too.Small warning: like all Shakespeare's plays, it's best to read ""Hamlet"" after you've seen a good performance, because the entire thing was intended to be acted out. Otherwise, it's like reading a movie script to a movie you haven't seen -- easy to get lost, and the dramatic effects aren't easy to connect to.But if you HAVE seen a good performance of ""Hamlet,"" then the play will just jump off the page. The plot is a relatively simple one, but it's tangled up in all sorts of moral dilemmas, personal doubts, deteriorating personal relationships, and a creeping undercurrent of darkness. The best part is that Shakespeare leaves you with all sorts of questions that are left up in the air -- is Hamlet crazy or just faking it? Is the ghost really his dad?And, of course, it contains some of the most intense, powerful examples of Shakespeare's work here -- vivid, nasty imagery (""In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed/Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love/Over the nasty sty""), some bleak humor (""you're a fishmonger""), and Hamlet's immortal soliloquies. It's also one of Shakespeare's most quotable plays -- obviously you've got bits like ""Alas, poor Yorick,"" ""to be or not to be"" and ""Something is rotten in the state of Denmark,"" but there are countless other familiar phrases littered through the text.On the page, Hamlet is basically an embittered young man who is torn between his doubts and convictions, but is still determined to fix things (""O cursed spite,/That ever I was born to set it right!""). A lot of the supporting cast are hard to follow, but there are some brilliant and enduring roles here -- the incestuous queen Gertrude, the subtle menace of Claudius, the windbag Laertes, and Ophelia, whose uncertainties spiral into madness after her ex-boyfriend kills her dad.It's best to get a grip on this classic tragedy by watching an actual performance, but reading ""Hamlet's"" text is a vivid experience on its own. Brilliant, complex and intense."

0786108487,The Awakening,32.95,A2NDRDYABCJV1R,Sara,0.75,5,1008374400,A Classic,"Kate Chopin's The Awakening, published in 1899, is not a typical literature book from this time period. Even though it was published 100 years ago, it is still relevant in this era today. Although in that time period, it appeared rebellious and was banned. Long before the women's rights movement Kate Chopin gave us Edna Pontellier, a woman who feels life is passing her by. She was the pampered wife of a wealthy man, the mother of two sons, and the mistress of a New Orleans mansion on the coast of Louisiana that left her unfulfilled.Edna, the protagonist, learns to think for herself as an independent woman and defies the norm by leaving her husband Leonce and having a love affair. She meets a young man named Robert Lebrun, the two spend almost all their time together and Edna greatly enjoys his company, especially when her husband was normally preoccupied with business. Over a period of time, Robert realizes that he and Edna are becoming too close; he suddenly departs the island and goes to Mexico for business reasons. He left and didn't want to be with her because he wasn't alike to her economically and couldn't make her happy. At the end of the story, Edna swims out into the ocean thinks gloriously about how she has escaped her children, their claim on her and continues to swim until she is dead tired. Memories of her childhood flash before her eyes as she gradually drowns. Edna's ""awakening&quot; one fateful summer, her quest for independence and refusal to sacrifice her individual existence is the basis of this novel. Her relations with other men, her friendships with women, and her ultimate fate, all of this made this a daring novel in 1899 and a startling reminder in 2001 of how far women have come. I personally feel this is a book everyone can relate to at one point or another and is a classic."

""We Are All The Same written by Jim Wooten deserves a five-star rating for is raw and real depiction of not only the life of young Nkosi Johnson, but of that of his world in which he and so many others live. With the help and love from two mothers Nkosi used his life to bring the world's attention to his killer; making his own life an open book, this young child born to poverty only wanted to help others living with and dying from Aids; although, the author indulges readers into aspects of his life that are irrelevant to the story, or the life of Nkosi this does not take away from the strong courageous, and heartfelt message that this book delivers.In the late eighty's and early nineties the word Aid's was believed to be here in America as a gay disease. But in Africa a continent that this disease took hostage quietly over the years this was the number one killer. Not just of gays or loose women, but for wives, husbands, and their children. One child born with this disease that was passed to him unknowingly from his mother used his illness to reach out and teach a nation.Handy 2Unlike most children born with Aid's; Nkosi was given a second life when his mother did the only thing she felt she could to protect her son, and that was to take Nkosi where she felt he would be safe from the life, and people around him. Living in a shelter for aids victim's as a baby Nkosi was taken in by the shelters founder and her family when the shelter went bankrupt. It was there in that house, with that loving family Nkosi received the love, nourishment, and courage to live his life.Gail Johnson, and her family not only took in a baby who was at the time HIV positive, but together they took on his disease. Every battle was fought together as a family, and every triumph was celebrated together as a family. In the house Nkosi received the love that kept him living longer than he was expected to. It was with this love he and his foster mother felt for other Aids victims that sent the two of them on his life long crusade. From his first interview with Nkosi Johnson Jim Wooten admits to being drawn to him, and the courageous women that loved him.This book is truly a treasure. I was moved and enlightened by the story of this young boy's life. From this book any one who reads it will be in for an emotional treat that will live in your heart and memory forever. It educated me on the crusade of Hiv and Aid's, and just how far we as people have come with the acceptance and understanding of it's victims.

The conspiracy became a deus ex machina upon which Perry could blame anything, which removed the necessity of proper plot construction, and Pitt stopped being a cop and became a secret agent, a sort of ur-Bond, in the employ of Special Branch. Sir Charles Voisey, the head of the Inner Circle, especially, was presented as the personification of melodramatic evil -- Snidely Whiplash with a nice house, servants, and a carriage. Pitt (and his boss, Narraway) orchestrated Voisey's fall from power, in any case, and in this somewhat wild-eyed volume, Voisey's rival, Superintendent Wetron, spins his own conspiracy: A group of anarchists (read ""terrorists"") are accused (justly) of blowing up houses and (unjustly) callously killing civilians. Wetron's motive is to ensure passage of an Act of Parliament giving the police greatly increased firepower, as well as enormous stop-and-search powers and the authority to enter private homes and ask any questions they like. ""Snatched from the headlines,"" as they say. (I imagine Perry is no fan of the present U.S. neocon administration.) The immediate result is to push Pitt and Voisey into a grudging and very suspicious partnership in order to defeat the bill, each for his own reasons. That part of the story is quite well done in its depiction of the very opposite characters of the two men -- and Perry makes up for the unbelievability of much of the rest of the plot by rather decisively killing off the entire Inner Circle conspiracy at the end. Ya-hoo!"
